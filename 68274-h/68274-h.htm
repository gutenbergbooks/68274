<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE GAME WELL BEGUN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sir Harold Wynde, Baronet, was standing upon the
pier head at Brighton, looking idly seaward, and watching
the play of the sunset rays on the waters, the tossing
white-capped waves, and the white sails in the
distance against the blue sky.</p>

<p>He was not yet fifty years of age, tall and handsome
and stately, with fair complexion, fair hair, and keen
blue eyes, which at times beamed with a warm and
genial radiance that seemed to emanate from his soul.
The rare nobility of that soul expressed itself in his features.
His commanding intellect betrayed itself in his
square, massive brows. His grand nature was patent in
every look and smile. He was a widower with two
children, the elder a son, who was a captain in a fine
regiment in India, the younger a daughter still at boarding-school.
He possessed a magnificent estate in Kent,
a house in town, and a marine villa, and rejoiced in a
clear income of seventy thousand pounds a year.</p>

<p>As might be expected from his rare personal and material
advantages, he was a lion at Brighton, even<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
though the season was at its height, and peers and peeresses
abounded at that fashionable resort. Titled ladies&mdash;to
use a well-worn phrase&mdash;“set their caps” for him;
manœuvring mammas smiled upon him; portly papas
with their “quivers full of daughters,” and with groaning
purses, urged him to dine at their houses or hotels;
and widows of every age looked sweetly at him, and
thought how divine it would be to be chosen to reign as
mistress over the baronet’s estate of Hawkhurst.</p>

<p>But Sir Harold went his ways quietly, seeming oblivious
of the hopes and schemes of these manœuverers.
He had had a good wife, and he had no intention of
marrying again. And so, as he stood carelessly leaning
against the railing on the pier head, under the gay awning,
his thoughts were far away from the gaily dressed
promenaders sauntering down the chain pier or pacing
with slow steps to and fro behind him.</p>

<p>The sunset glow slowly faded. The long gray English
twilight began to fall slowly upon promenaders,
beach, chain pier, and waters. The music of the band
swallowed up all other sounds, the murmur of waters,
the hum of gay voices, the sweetness of laughter.</p>

<p>But suddenly, in one of the interludes of the music,
and in the midst of Sir Harold’s reverie, an incident occurred
which was the beginning of a chain of events
destined to change the whole future course of the baronet’s
life, and to exercise no slight degree of influence
upon the lives of others.</p>

<p>Yet the incident was simple. A little pleasure-boat,
occupied by two ladies and a boatman, had been sailing
leisurely about the pier head for some time. The
boatman, one of the ordinary pleasure boatmen who
make a living at Brighton, as at other maritime resorts,
by letting their crafts and services to chance customers,
had been busy with his sail. One of the ladies, a hired<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
companion apparently, sat at one side of the boat, with
a parasol on her knee. The other lady, as evidently the
employer, half reclined upon the plush cushions, and an
Indian shawl of vivid scarlet lavishly embroidered with
gold was thrown carelessly about her figure. One cheek
of this lady rested upon her jewelled hand, and her eyes
were fixed with a singular intentness, a peculiar speculativeness,
upon the tall and stalwart figure of Sir
Harold Wynde.</p>

<p>There was a world of meaning in that long furtive
gaze, and had the baronet been able to read and comprehend
it, the tragical history we are about to narrate
would never have happened. But he, wrapped in his
own thoughts, saw neither the boat nor its occupants.</p>

<p>The little craft crept in quite near to the pier head&mdash;so
near as to be but a few rods distant&mdash;when the boatman
shifted his helm to go about and stand upon the
other tack. The small vessel gave a lurch, the wind
blowing freshly; the lady with the Indian shawl started
up, with a shriek; there was an instant of terrible confusion;
and then the sail-boat had capsized, and her late
occupants were struggling in the waters.</p>

<p>In a moment the promenaders of the chain pier had
thronged upon the pier head. Cries and ejaculations
filled the air. No one could comprehend how the accident
had occurred, but one man who had been watching
the boat averred that the lady with the shawl had deliberately
and purposely capsized it. <em>And this was the actual
fact!</em></p>

<p>Sir Harold Wynde was startled from the trance-like
musings by the lady’s shriek. He looked down upon the
waters and beheld the result of the catastrophe. The
boat’s sail lay half under water. The boatman had
seized the lady’s companion and was clinging to the upturned
boat. The companion had fainted in his arms,<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
and he could not loosen his hold upon her unless he
would have her drown before his eyes. The lady, at a
little distance from her companions in peril, tangled in
her mass of scarlet and gold drapery, her hat lost, her
long hair trailing on the waves, seemed drowning.</p>

<p>Her peril was imminent. No other boats were near,
although one or two were coming up swiftly from a distance.</p>

<p>The lady threw up her white arms with an anguished
cry. Her glance sought the thronged pier head in wild
appealing. Who, looking at her, would have dreamed
that the disaster was part of a well-contrived plan&mdash;a
trap to catch the unwary baronet?</p>

<p>As she had expected from his well-known chivalrous
character, he fell into the trap. His keen eyes flashed a
rapid glance over beach and waters. The lady was likely
to drown before help could come from the speeding
boats. Sir Harold pulled off his coat and made a dive
into the sea. He was an expert swimmer, and reached
the lady as she was sinking. He caught her in his arms
and struck out for the boat. The lady became a dead
weight, and when he reached the capsized craft her head
lay back on his breast, her long wet tresses of hair coiled
around him like Medusean locks, and her pale face was
like the face of a dead woman.</p>

<p>Sir Harold clung to the side of the boat opposite that
on which the boatman supported his burden. And thus
he awaited the coming of the boats.</p>

<p>Among the eager thronging watchers on the pier head
above was a tall, fair-faced man, with a long, waxed
mustache, sinister eyes and a cynical smile. He alone of
the throng seemed unmoved by the tragic incident.</p>

<p>“It was pretty well done,” he muttered, under his
breath&mdash;“a little transparent, perhaps, and a trifle awkward
as well, but pretty well done! The baronet fell<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
into the trap too, exactly as was hoped. Your campaign
opens finely, my beautiful Octavia. Let us see if the
result is to be what we desire. In short, will the baronet
be as unsuspicious all the way through?”</p>

<p>Sir Harold certainly was unsuspicious at that moment.
The helpless woman in his arms aroused into activity
all the chivalry of his chivalric nature. He held her
head above the creeping waves until the foremost boat
had reached him. His burden was the first to be lifted
into the rescuing craft; the lady’s companion followed;
the baronet and the boatman climbing into the boat
last, in the order in which they are named.</p>

<p>The capsized boat was righted and its owner took
possession of her. The rescuing craft transported the
baronet and the two ladies to the beach. The lady companion
had recovered her senses and self-possession, but
the lady employer lay on the cushions pale and motionless.</p>

<p>On reaching the landing, a cab was found to be in
waiting, having been summoned by some sympathizing
spectator. The companion, uttering protestations of
gratitude, entered the vehicle, and her mistress was assisted
in after her. The former gathered her employer
in her arms, crying out:</p>

<p>“She is dead! She is dead! I have lost my best
friend&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not so, madam,” said Sir Harold, in kindly sympathy.
“The lady has only fainted, I think. To what
place shall I tell the cabman to drive?”</p>

<p>“To the Albion Hotel. Oh, my poor, poor lady! To
die so young! It is terrible!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold made some soothing response, but being
chilled and wet, did not find it necessary to accompany
to their hotel the heroines of the adventure. He gave
their address to the cabman, watched the cab as it rolled<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
away, and then breaking loose from the crowd of friends
who gathered around him with anxious interrogatories,
he secured his coat and procured a cab for himself and
proceeded to his own hotel.</p>

<p>It was not until he had had a comfortable bath, and
was seated in dry attire in his private parlor, that Sir
Harold remembered that he did not know the name of
the lady he had served, or that he had not even seen her
face distinctly.</p>

<p>“She is as ignorant of my name and identity,” he
thought, “as I am of hers. If the incident could be
kept out of the papers, I need never be troubled with
the thanks of her husband, father, or brother.”</p>

<p>But the incident was not kept out of the papers. Sir
Harold Wynde, being a lion, had to bear the penalty of
popularity. The next morning’s paper, brought in to
him as he sat at his solitary breakfast, contained a glowing
account of the previous evening’s adventure, under
the flaming head line of “Heroic Action by a Baronet,”
with the sub-lines: “Sir Harold Wynde saves a lady’s
life at the risk of his own. Chivalry not yet dead in our
commonplace England.” And there followed a highly
imaginative description of the lady’s adventure, her
name being as yet unknown, and a warm eulogy upon
Sir Harold’s bravery and presence of mind.</p>

<p>The baronet’s lip curled as he read impatiently the
fulsome article. He had scarcely finished it when a
waiter entered, bringing in upon a silver tray a large
squarely enveloped letter. It was addressed to Sir Harold
Wynde, was stamped with an unintelligible monogram,
and sealed with a dainty device in pale green
wax. As the baronet’s only lady correspondent was
his daughter at school, and this missive was clearly not
from her, he experienced a slight surprise at its reception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>The waiter having departed, Sir Harold cut open the
letter with his pocket knife, and glanced over its contents.</p>

<p>They were written upon the daintiest, thickest vellum
paper unlined, and duly tinted and monogrammed, and
were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ir1"><span class="smcap">Albion Hotel</span>, Tuesday Morning.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir Harold Wynde</span>: The lady who writes this letter
is the lady whom you so gallantly rescued from a
death by drowning last evening. I have read the accounts
of your daring bravery in the morning’s papers,
and hasten to offer my grateful thanks for your noble
and gallant kindness to an utter stranger. Life has not
been so sweet to me that I cling to it, but yet it is very
horrible to go in one moment from the glow and heartiness
of health and life down to the very gates of death.
It was your hand that drew me back at the moment
when those gates opened to admit me, and again I bless
you&mdash;a thousand thousand times, I bless you. Alas, that
I have to write to you myself. I have neither father,
lover, nor husband, to rejoice in the life you have saved.
I am a widow, and alone in the wide world. Will you
not call upon me at my hotel and permit me to thank
you far more effectively in person? I shall be waiting
for your coming in my private parlor at eleven this
morning.</p>

<p class="ir1 pminus1"><span style="padding-right:5em">“Gratefully yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Octavia Hathaway</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The baronet read the letter again and again. His
generous soul was touched by its sorrowful tone.</p>

<p>“A widow and alone in the world!” he thought.
“Poor woman! What sentence could be sadder than
that? She is elderly, I am sure, and has lost all her
children. I do not want to hear her expressions of gratitude,
but if I can make the poor soul happier by calling
on her I will go.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, at eleven o’clock that morning, attired
in a gentleman’s unexceptionable morning dress, Sir<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
Harold Wynde, having sent up his card, presented himself
at the door of Mrs. Hathaway’s private parlor at the
Albion Hotel, and knocked for admittance.</p>

<p>The door was opened to him by the lady’s companion,
who greeted him with effusiveness, and begged him to
be seated.</p>

<p>She was a tall, angular woman, with sharp features,
whose characteristic expression was one of peculiar hardness
and severity. Her lips were thin, and were usually
compressed. Her eyes were a light gray, furtive and sly,
like a cat’s eyes. Her pointed chin gave a treacherous
cast to her countenance. Her complexion was of a pale,
opaque gray; her hair, of a fawn color, was worn in
three puffs on each side of her face, and her dress was of
a tint to match her hair. Sir Harold conceived an instinctive
aversion to her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hathaway?” he said politely, with interrogative
accent.</p>

<p>“No, I am not Mrs. Hathaway,” was the reply, in a
subdued voice, and the furtive eyes scanned the visitor’s
face. “I am only Mrs. Hathaway’s companion&mdash;Mrs.
Artress. Mrs. Hathaway has just received your card.
She will be out directly.”</p>

<p>The words were scarcely spoken when the door of an
inner room opened, and Mrs. Hathaway made her appearance.</p>

<p>Sir Harold stood up, bowing.</p>

<p>The lady was by no means the elderly, melancholy
personage he had expected to see. She was about thirty
years of age, and looked younger. She had a tall, statuesque
figure, well-rounded and inclined to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</i>.
She carried her head with a certain stateliness. Her hair
was dressed with the inevitable chignon, crimped waves,
and long, floating curl, and despite the monstrosity of
the fashion, it was decidedly and undeniably picturesque.<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
Her face, with its clear brunette complexion, liquid black
eyes, Grecian nose, low brows, and faultless mouth, was
very handsome. There was a fascination in her manners
that was felt by the baronet even before she had spoken.</p>

<p>She was not dressed in mourning, and it was probable,
therefore, that her widowhood was not of recent beginning.
She was clothed in an exquisitely embroidered
morning dress of white, which trailed on the floor, and
was relieved with ornaments of pale pink coral, and a
broad coral-colored sash at her waist.</p>

<p>“<em>This</em> is Mrs. Hathaway, Sir Harold,” said the gray
looking lady’s companion.</p>

<p>The lady sprang forward after an impulsive fashion, and
clasped the baronet’s hands in both her own. Her black
eyes flooded with tears. And then, in a broken voice,
she thanked her preserver for his gallant conduct on
the previous evening assuring him that her gratitude
would outlast her life. Her protestations and gratitude
were not overdone, and unsuspecting Sir Harold
accepted them as genuine, even while they embarrassed
him.</p>

<p>He remained an hour, finding Mrs. Hathaway charming
company and thoroughly fascinating. The companion
sat apart, silent, busy with embroidery, a mere gray
shadow; but her presence gave an easy unconstraint to
both the baronet and the lady. When Sir Harold took
his departure, sauntering down to the German Spa, he
carried with him the abiding memory of Mrs. Hathaway’s
handsome brunette face and liquid black eyes, and
thought himself that she was the most charming woman
he had met for years.</p>

<p>From that day, throughout the season, the baronet was
a frequent visitor at Mrs. Hathaway’s private parlor.
The gray companion was always at hand to play propriety,
and the tongues of gossips, though busy, had no<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
malevolence in them. Sir Harold had his own horses at
Brighton, and placed one at Mrs. Hathaway’s disposal.
The widow accepted it, procured a bewitching costume
from town, and had daily rides with the baronet. She
also drove with him in his open, low carriage, and bowed
right and left to her acquaintances upon such occasions
with the gracious condescension of a princess. She
sailed with him in his graceful yacht, upon day’s excursions,
her companion always accompanying, and rumor
at length declared that the pair were engaged to be
married.</p>

<p>Sir Harold heard the reports, and they set him thinking.
The society of Mrs. Hathaway had become necessary
to him. She understood his tastes, studying them
with a flattery so delicate that he was pleased without
understanding it. She read his favorite books, played
his favorite music, and displayed talents of no mean
order. She was fitted to adorn any position, however
high, and Sir Harold thought with a pleasant thrill at his
heart, how royally she would reign over his beautiful
home.</p>

<p>In short, questioning his own heart, he found that he
had worshiped his dead wife, who would be to him always
young, as when he had buried her&mdash;but with the
passion of later manhood, an exacting, jealous yearning
affection, which gives all and demands all. With his
children far from him, his life had been lonely, and he
had known many desolate hours, when he would have
given half his wealth for sympathy and love.</p>

<p>“I shall find both in Octavia,” he thought, his noble
face brightening. “I shall not wrong my children in
marrying her. My son will be my heir. My daughter’s
fortune will not be imperilled by my second marriage.
Neva is sixteen, and in two years more will come home.
How can I do better for her than to give her a beautiful<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
mother, young enough to win her confidence, old enough
to be her guide? Octavia would love my girl, and would
be her best chaperon in society, to which Neva must be
by and by introduced. I should find in Octavia then a
mother for my daughter, and a gentle loving wife and
companion for myself. But will she accept me?”</p>

<p>He put the question to the test that very evening. He
found the handsome widow alone in her parlor, the gray
companion being for once absent, and he told her his
love with a tremulous ardor and passion that it would
have been the glory of a good woman to have evoked from
a nature so grand as Sir Harold’s.</p>

<p>The fascinating widow blushed and smiled assent, and
her black-tressed head drooped to his shoulder, and Sir
Harold clasped her in his arms as his betrothed wife.</p>

<p>With a lover’s impetuosity he begged her to marry
him at an early day. She hesitated coyly, as if for
months she had not been striving and praying for this
hour, and then was won to consent to marry him a
month thence.</p>

<p>“I am alone in the world, and have no one to consult,”
she sighed. “I have an old aunt, a perfect miser, who
lives in Bloomsbury Square, in London. She will permit
me to be married from her house, as I was before.
The marriage will have to be very quiet, for she is averse
to display and expense. However, what she saves will
come to me some day, so I need not complain. I shall
want to keep Artress with me, Sir Harold. I can see
that you don’t like her, but she has been a faithful friend
to me in all my troubles, and I cannot abandon her when
prosperity smiles so splendidly upon me. I may keep
her, may I not?”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Sir Harold smothered his dislike of
the gray companion, and consented that she should
become an inmate of his house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hathaway proceeded to explain the causes of her
friendlessness. She was an orphan, and had early married
the Honorable Charles Hathaway, the younger son
of a Viscount, who had died five years before. The
Honorable Charles had been a dissipated spendthrift, and
had left his wife the meagre income of some three hundred
pounds a year. Her elegant clothing was, for the
most part, relics of better days. As to the expensive
style in which she lived, keeping a companion and maid,
no one knew, save herself and one other, how she managed
to support it. Her name and reputation were unblemished,
and the most censorious tongue had nothing
to say against her.</p>

<p>And yet she was none the less an unscrupulous,
unprincipled adventuress.</p>

<p>This was the woman, the noble, gallant baronet proposed
to take to his bosom as his wife, to endow with
his name and wealth, to make the mother and guide of
his pure young daughter. Would the sacrifice of the
generous, unsuspected lover be permitted?</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> permitted. A month later their modest bridal
train swept beneath the portals of St. George’s Church,
Hanover Square. The bride, radiant in pearl-colored
moire, with point lace overdress, wore a magnificent parure
of diamonds, presented to her by Sir Harold. The
baronet looked the picture of happiness. The miserly
aunt of Mrs. Hathaway, a skinny old lady in a low-necked
and short-sleeved dress of pink silk, that, by its
unsuitability, made her seem absolutely hideous, attended
by a male friend, who gave away the bride, was
prominent among the group that surrounded the altar.</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s son and heir was in India, and his daughter
had not been summoned from her boarding-school in
Paris. The baronet’s tender father soul yearned for his
daughter’s presence at his second marriage; but Lady<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
Wynde had urged that Neva’s studies should not be interrupted,
and had begged, as a personal favor, that her
meeting with her young step-daughter might be delayed
until her ladyship had become used to her new position.
She professed to be timid and shrinking in regard to the
meeting with Neva, and Sir Harold, in his passionate
love for Octavia, put aside his own wishes, yielding to
her request. But he had written to his daughter, announcing
his intended second marriage, and had received
in reply a tender, loving letter full of earnest prayers for
his happiness, and expressing the kindest feelings toward
the expected step-mother.</p>

<p>The words were spoken that made the strangely
assorted pair one flesh. As the bride arose from her
knees the wife of a wealthy baronet, the wearer of a
title, the handsome face was lighted by a triumphant
glow, her black eyes emitted a singular, exultant gleam,
and a conscious triumph pervaded her manner.</p>

<p>She had played the first part of a daring game&mdash;and
she had won!</p>

<p>As she passed into the vestry to sign the marriage register,
leaning proudly upon the arm of her newly made
husband, and followed by her few attending personal
friends, a man who had witnessed the ceremony from
behind a clustered pillar in the church, stole out into the
square, his face lighted by a lurid smile, his eyes emitting
the same peculiar, exultant gleam as the bride’s had
done.</p>

<p>This man was the tall, fair-haired gentleman, with
waxed mustaches, sinister eyes and cynical smile, who,
nearly three months before, had witnessed from the pier
head at Brighton the rescue of Mrs. Hathaway from the
sea by Sir Harold Wynde. And now this man muttered:</p>

<p>“The game prospers. Octavia is Lady Wynde. The<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
first act is played. The next act requires more time,
deliberation, caution. Every move must be considered
carefully. We are bound to win the entire game.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DECISIVE MOVE COMMANDED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sir Harold and Lady Wynde ate their wedding breakfast
in Bloomsbury Square, at the house of Lady
Wynde’s miserly aunt, Mrs. Hyde. A few of the baronet’s
choice friends were present. The absence of Sir
Harold’s daughter was not especially remarked save by
the father, who longed with an anxious longing to see
her face smiling upon him, and to hear her young voice
whispering congratulations upon his second marriage.
Neva had been especially near and dear to him. Her
mother had died in her babyhood, and he had been both
father and mother to his girl. He had early sent his
son to school, but Neva he had kept with him until, a
year before, his first wife’s relatives had urged him to
send her to a “finishing school” at Paris, and he had
reluctantly yielded. Not even his passionate love for
his bride could overcome or lessen the fatherly love and
tenderness of years.</p>

<p>Immediately after the breakfast the newly married
pair proceeded to Canterbury by special train. The gray
companion and Lady Wynde’s maid traveled in another
compartment of the same coach. The Hawkhurst carriage
was in waiting for the bridal pair at the station.
Sir Harold assisted his wife into it, addressed a few
kindly words to the old coachman on the box, and<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
entered the vehicle. The gray companion and the maid
entered a dog-cart, also in waiting. Hawkhurst was
several miles distant, but the country between it and
Canterbury was a charming one, and Lady Wynde found
sufficient enjoyment in looking at the handsome seats,
the trim hedges, and thrifty hop-gardens, and in wondering
if Hawkhurst would realize her expectations.
She found indeed more enjoyment in her own speculations
than in the society of her husband.</p>

<p>About five o’clock of the afternoon, the bridal pair
came in sight of the ancestral home of the Wynde’s.
The top of the low barouche was lowered and Sir
Harold pointed out her future home to his bride with
pardonable pride, and she surveyed it with eager eyes.</p>

<p>It was, as we have said, a magnificent estate, divided
into numerous farms of goodly size. The home grounds
of Hawkhurst proper, including the fields, pastures,
meadows, parks, woods, plantations and gardens, comprised
about four hundred acres. The mansion stood
upon a ridge of ground some half a mile wide, and was
seen from several points at a distance of three or four
miles. It was a grand old building of gray stone, with
a long facade, and was three stories in height. Its turrets
and chimneys were noted for their picturesqueness.
Its carved stone porches, its quaint wide windows, its
steep roof, from which pert dormer-windows, saucily
projected, were remarkable for their beauty or oddity.
Despite its age, and its air of grandeur and stateliness,
there was a home-like look about the great mansion
that Lady Wynde did not fail to perceive at the first
glance.</p>

<p>The house was flanked on either side by glass pineries,
grape houses, hothouses, greenhouses and similar buildings.
Further to the left of the dwelling, beyond the
sunny gardens, was the great park, intersected with<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
walks and drives, having a lake somewhere in the
umbrageous depths, and herds of fallow-deer browsing
on its herbage. In the rear of the house, built in the
form of a quadrangle, of gray stone, were the handsome
stables and offices of various descriptions. The mansion
with its dependencies covered a great deal of
ground, and presented an imposing appearance.</p>

<p>The house was approached by a shaded drive a half
mile or more in length, which traversed a smooth green
lawn dotted here and there with trees. A pair of bronze
gates, protected and attended by a picturesque gray
stone lodge, gave ingress to the grounds.</p>

<p>These gates swung open at the approach of Sir Harold
Wynde and his bride, and the gate-keeper and his
family came out bowing and smiling, to welcome home
the future lady of Hawkhurst. Lady Wynde returned
their greetings with graceful condescension, and then,
as the carriage entered the drive, she fixed her eager
eyes upon the long gray facade of the mansion, and
said:</p>

<p>“It is beautiful&mdash;magnificent! You never did justice
to its grandeurs, Harold, in describing Hawkhurst. It
is strange that a house so large, and of such architectural
pretension, should have such a bright and sunny
appearance. The sunlight must flood every room in
that glorious front. I should like to live all my days at
Hawkhurst!”</p>

<p>“Your dower house will be as pleasant a home as this
although not so pretentious,” said Sir Harold, smiling
gravely. “It is probable that you being twenty years
my junior, will survive me, Octavia, and therefore I have
settled upon you for your life use in your possible
widowhood one of my prettiest places, and one which
has served for many generations as the residence of the
dowager widows of our family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>The glow on Lady Wynde’s face faded a little, and
her lips slightly compressed themselves, as they were
wont to do when she was ill pleased.</p>

<p>“I have never asked you about your property, Harold,”
she remarked, “but your wife need be restrained
from doing so by no sense of delicacy. I suppose your
property is entailed?”</p>

<p>“Hawkhurst is entailed, but it will fall to the female
line in case of the dying out of heirs male,” replied the
baronet, not marking his bride’s scarcely suppressed
eagerness. “It has belonged to our family from time
immemorial, and was a royal grant to one of our ancestors
who saved his monarch’s life at risk of his own.
Thus, at my death, Hawkhurst will go, with the title,
to my son. If George should die, without issue, Hawkhurst&mdash;without
the title, which is a separate affair&mdash;will
go to my daughter.”</p>

<p>“A weighty inheritance for a girl,” remarked Lady
Wynde. “And&mdash;and if she should die without issue?”</p>

<p>“The estate would go to distant cousins of mine.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde started. This was evidently an unexpected
reply, and she could not repress her looks of disappointment.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I should think your wife would come before your
cousins,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“How little you know about law, Octavia,” said the
baronet, with a grave, gentle smile. “The property
must go to those of our blood. If our union is blessed
with children, the eldest of them would inherit Hawkhurst
before my cousins. But although the law has proclaimed
us one flesh, yet it does not allow you to become
the heir of my entailed property. It is singular even
that a daughter is permitted to inherit before male
cousins, but there was a clause in the royal deed of gift
of Hawkhurst to my ancestors that gave the property<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
to females in the direct line, in default of male heirs, but
there has never been a female proprietor of the estate.
I hope there never may be. I should hate to have the
old name die out of the old place. But here we are at
the house. Welcome home, my beautiful wife!”</p>

<p>The carriage stopped in the porch, and Sir Harold
alighted and assisted out his bride. He drew her arm
through his and led her up the lofty flight of stone steps,
and in at the arched and open door-way. The servants
were assembled to welcome home their lady, and the
baronet uttered the necessary words of introduction and
conducted his bride to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>This was an immensely long apartment, with nine
wide windows on its eastern side looking out upon gardens
and park. Sculptured arches, supported by slender
columns of alabaster, relieved the long vista, and curtains
depending from them were capable of dividing the
grand room into three handsome ones. The drawing-room
was furnished in modern style, and was all gayety,
brightness and beauty. The furniture, of daintiest
satin-wood, was upholstered in pale blue silk. The carpet,
of softest gray hue, was bordered with blue.</p>

<p>“It is very lovely,” commented the bride. “And that
is a conservatory at the end? I shall be very happy
here, Harold.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” was the earnest response. “But let me
take you up to your own rooms, Octavia. They have
been newly furnished for your occupancy.”</p>

<p>He gave her his arm and conducted her out into the
wide hall, with its tesselated floor, up the wide marble
staircase, to a suit of rooms directly over the drawing-room.</p>

<p>This suit comprised sitting-room, bedroom, dressing-room
and bath-room. Their upholstery was of a vivid
crimson hue. A faultless taste had guided the selection<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
of the various adornments, and Lady Wynde’s eyes kindled
with appreciation as she marked the costliness and
beauty of everything around her.</p>

<p>“Your trunks have arrived in the wagon, Octavia,”
said her husband, well pleased with her commendations.
“Mrs. Artress and your maid, who came on in the dog-cart,
have also arrived. Dinner has been ordered at
seven. I will leave you to dress. And, by the way,
should you have need of me, my dressing-room adjoins
your own.”</p>

<p>He went out. Lady Wynde rang for her maid and
her gray companion, and dressed for dinner. When her
toilet was made, the baronet’s bride dismissed her maid
and came out into her warm-hued sitting room, where
Mrs. Artress sat by a window looking out into the leafy
shadows of the park.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the beauty interrogatively. “What do
you think? Have I not been successful?”</p>

<p>“So far, yes,” said the grim, ashen-faced companion,
raising her light, hay-colored eyes in a meaning expression.
“But the end is not yet. The game, you know,
is only fairly begun.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said the bride thoughtfully. “But it
is well begun. But hush, Artress. Here comes my happy
bridegroom!”</p>

<p>There was a mocking smile on her lips as she bade
Sir Harold enter. The wedded pair had a few minutes’
conversation in the sitting-room, her ladyship’s companion
sitting in the deep window seat mute as a shadow,
and they then descended to the drawing-room. Mrs.
Artress meekly followed. She remained near Lady
Wynde, in attendance upon her until after dinner, and
then went up to her own room, which was in convenient
proximity to the apartments of Lady Wynde.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom were left to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>The former played a little upon the grand piano, and
then approached her husband, sitting down beside him
upon the same sofa. His noble face beamed love upon
her. But her countenance grew hard with speculative
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said she, speaking with well-assumed
lightness. “What were we talking about when we arrived,
Harold? Oh, about your property! So, this
dear old Hawkhurst will belong to George? And what
will Neva have?”</p>

<p>“Her mother’s fortune, and several estates which are
not entailed. Neva will be a very rich woman without
Hawkhurst. You also, Octavia, will be handsomely provided
for, without detriment to my children.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” said Lady Wynde. “But if the
estates are not entailed which you intend to give to
Neva, you must leave them to her by will. Have&mdash;have
you made your will?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but since I have contracted a new marriage, I
shall have to make a new will. I shall attend to that at
my leisure.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde became thoughtful, but did not press the
subject. She excused her questionings on the plea of
interest in her husband’s children, and Sir Harold gave
no thought to them.</p>

<p>The days went by; the weeks and months followed.
Neva Wynde had not been summoned home, her step-mother
finding plenty of excuses for deferring the return
of her step-daughter. Perhaps she feared that a
pair of keen young eyes, unvailed by glamor, would
see how morally hideous she was&mdash;how base and scheming,
and unworthy of her husband.</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s infatuation with his wife deepened as the
time wore on. His love for her became a species of
worship. All that she did was good in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>Lady Wynde went into society, visited the first county
families, and received them at Hawkhurst. She gave a
ball, dancing and dinner parties, “tea-fights,” and fetes
champetres, without number. She promoted festivities
of every sort, and became one of the most popular ladies
in the county. She was a leader of fashion too, and
withal was so gracious, so circumspect, so full of delicate
flattery to every one, that even venomous tongued gossip
had naught but good to say of her. Her position at
Hawkhurst was thus firmly established, and she might
be called a happy woman.</p>

<p>As the months went on, an air of expectancy began to
be apparent in her manner. The gray companion shared
it, moving with a suppressed eagerness and nervousness,
as if waiting for something. And that which she waited
for came at last.</p>

<p>It was one February evening, more than a year after
the bride’s coming home to Hawkhurst. Outside the
night was wild. Within Lady Wynde’s dressing-room
the fire glowed behind its silvered bars, and its rays
danced in bright gleams upon the crimson furniture.
The lamps burned with mellow radiance. In the centre
of the room stood the lady of Hawkhurst. She had dismissed
her maid, and was surveying her reflection in a
full-length mirror with a complacent smile.</p>

<p>She was attired in a long robe of crimson silk, and
wore her ruby ornaments. Her neck and arms were bare.
Her liquid black eyes were full of light; her face was
aglow.</p>

<p>In the midst of her self-admiration, her gray companion
entered abruptly, bearing in her hand a letter. Lady
Wynde turned toward her with a startled look.</p>

<p>“What have you there, Artress?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“A letter addressed to me,” was the reply. “I have
read it. I have a question to ask you, Octavia, before<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
I show the letter to you. Sir Harold Wynde adores
you. He loads you with gifts. He lays his heart under
your feet. You are his world, his life, his very soul.
And now I want to ask you&mdash;do you love him?”</p>

<p>The ashen eyes shot a piercing glance into the handsome
brunette face, but the black eyes met hers boldly
and the full lips curled in a contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>“Love him?” repeated Lady Wynde. “You know I
do not. Love him? You know that I love another even
as Sir Harold loves me! Love him? Bah!”</p>

<p>The gray woman smiled a strange mirthless smile.</p>

<p>“It is well,” she said. “Now read the letter. The
message has come at last!”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde seized the letter eagerly. It contained
only these words, without date or signature:</p>

<p>“<em>The time has come to get rid of him!</em> Now!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FATEFUL MOVE DECIDED UPON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Notwithstanding that the sinister message, contained
in the single line of the mysterious missive brought to
Lady Wynde by her gray companion, had been long expected,
it brought with it none the less a shock when it
came.</p>

<p>The paper fluttered slowly from the unloosed fingers
of the baronet’s wife to the floor, and into the liquid
black eyes stole a look half of horror and half of eagerness.
Unconsciously her voice repeated the words of
the message, in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>“<em>It is time to get rid of him.</em> Now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>Lady Wynde shuddered at the sound of her own voice,
and she stared at her gray companion, her eyes full of
shrinking and terror. Those ashen orbs returned her
stare with one that was bold, evil, and encouraging.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I haven’t the courage I thought, Artress,” faltered
her ladyship. “It is a terrible thing to do!”</p>

<p>“You love Sir Harold, after all?” taunted the companion,
as she picked up the sinister slip of paper and
burned it.</p>

<p>“No, no, but he trusts me; he loves me. There was
a time, Artress, when I could not have harmed a dog that
licked my hand or fawned upon me. And now&mdash;but I
am not so bad as you think. I am base, unscrupulous,
manœuvring, I know. My marriage was but part of a
wicked plan, the fruit of a conspiracy against Sir Harold
Wynde, but I shrink from the crowning evil we have
planned. To play the viper and sting the hand that has
warmed me&mdash;to wound to the core the heart that beats so
fondly and proudly for me&mdash;to&mdash;to cut short the noble,
beneficent, happy life of Sir Harold&mdash;oh, I cannot! I
cannot!”</p>

<p>Her ladyship swept forward impetuously toward the
hearth and knelt down before a quaint crimson-cushioned
chair, crossing her arms upon it, and laying her head on
her bare white arms. The firelight played upon the
ruddy waves of her long robe, upon the gems at her
throat and wrists, upon her picturesquely dishevelled
hair, and upon her stormy, handsome face. She stared
into the fire with her great black terrified eyes, as if
seeking in those dancing flames some mystic meaning.</p>

<p>Her gray companion flitted across the floor to her
side like an evil shadow.</p>

<p>“How very tragic you are, my lady,” she said, with a
sneer. “It almost seems as if you were doing a scene
out of a melodrama. No one can force you to any step<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
against your will. You can do whatever you please.
Sir Harold dotes upon you, and you can continue his
seemingly affectionate wife, can receive his caresses, can
preside over his household, and can soothe his declining
years. He is not yet fifty-eight years old, vigorous and
healthy, and, as he comes of a long-lived race, he will
live to be ninety, I doubt not. You will, should you survive
him, then be seventy. You can play the tender
step-mother to his children. His daughter is sure to
dislike you, and she may cause her father to distrust
you. All this will no doubt be pleasant to you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush!” breathed Lady Wynde, with a tempestuous
look in her eyes. “Let me alone, Artress. You
always stir up the demon within me. Forty years of a
dull, staid, respectable existence, when I might be a
queen of society in London, might be married to one I
have loved for years! Forty years! Why, one year seems
to me an eternity. It seems a lifetime since I was married
to Sir Harold. I&mdash;I will act upon the letter.”</p>

<p>The gray companion smiled.</p>

<p>“I was sure you would,” she said.</p>

<p>“But Sir Harold has not made a new will since our
marriage,” urged Lady Wynde. “By our marriage
settlements, I am to have the use of the dower house,
Wynde Heights, during my lifetime, and a life income
of four thousand pounds a year. At my death, both
house and income revert to the family of Wynde. I
have nothing absolutely my own, nothing left to me by
will to do with as I please. Craven expected that I
would have the dowry of a princess, I suppose, out of
Sir Harold’s splendid property.”</p>

<p>“It is not too late to acquire it,” said the companion,
significantly. “Sir Harold is clay in your hands. You
can mould him to any shape you will. He has no child
here to counteract your influence. He has money and<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
estates which he intends to leave by will to his daughter
Neva. If you are clever, you can divert into your own
coffers all of Miss Wynde’s property that is not settled
upon her already from her mother’s estate. It will do
no harm to delay acting upon the message for a day or
two, since something of so much importance remains to
be transacted.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful for even a day’s respite,” murmured
Lady Wynde. “I have been eager to receive the message,
intending to act upon it promptly. But I am not
all bad, Artress, and I shrink from the consummation
of our plans. If Sir Harold would only die naturally!
If something would only occur to remove him from my
path!”</p>

<p>She breathed heavily as she arose, shook out the folds
of her dress, and moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“The phial I had when we came here I found was
broken yesterday,” said Artress. “I shall have to go up
to London to-morrow for more of that fluid, so that
there must be a day’s delay in any case. We must be
very cautious, for people will wonder at the sudden
death of one so hale and strong, and should suspicion
arise, it must find no foundation to build upon.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde nodded assent, and opened the door and
went out with a weary step. She descended the broad
staircase, crossed the great hall, and entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Sir Harold was seated near the fire, in a thoughtful
reverie, but arose at her entrance with a beaming face
and a tender smile.</p>

<p>“It’s a wild night, Octavia,” he said. “Come forward
to the fire my darling. How pale you are! And you
are shivering with the cold.”</p>

<p>He gently forced her into the easy-chair he had vacated,<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
bent over her with lover-like devotion, patting her
head softly with his hand.</p>

<p>“You look unhappy, dear,” resumed the baronet, after
a pause. “Is there anything you want&mdash;a ball, jewels, a
trip to the Continent? You know my purse is yours,
and I am ready to go where you may wish to lead.”</p>

<p>“You are very good!” said Lady Wynde, her black
eyes fixed in a gaze upon the fire, and again she shivered.
“I&mdash;I am not worthy of all your kindness, Harold. Hark!
There is the dinner-bell. Thank fortune for the interruption,
for I believe I was growing really sentimental!”</p>

<p>She forced a laugh as she arose and took her husband’s
arm, and was conducted to the dining-room, but
there was something in her laughter that jarred upon
Sir Harold, although the unpleasant impression it produced
upon him was evanescent.</p>

<p>At the dinner Lady Wynde was herself again, bright
and fascinating, only now and then, in some pause of
the conversation, there came again into her eyes that
horrified stare which they had worn up stairs, and which
testified how her soul shrank from the awful crime she
contemplated.</p>

<p>After dinner the pair returned to the drawing-room.
Sir Harold drew a sofa toward the corner of the hearth
and sat down upon it, calling his wife to him. She
obeyed, taking a seat beside him. Her face was all
brightness at this moment, and Sir Harold forgot his late
anxieties about her.</p>

<p>“I believe I am the happiest man in the world, Octavia,”
he said thoughtfully, caressing one of her jewelled
hands he had lifted from her knee, “but my cup of joy
lacks a drop or two of sweetness still. You are all the
world to me, my wife, and yet I want something more.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want, Harold?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about my children,” said the<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
baronet. “It is over a month since I heard from George,
and he does not intend to leave India this year, although
I have urged him to sell his commission and come home.
The boy has a passion for a military life, and he went
out to India against my better judgment. I cannot have
George home again this year, but there is Neva near
me. I long to see her, Octavia.”</p>

<p>“You are the most devoted of fathers,” laughed Lady
Wynde. “We have been married but little over a year,
and yet you have made two trips alone to Paris to see
Neva. She must be a very paragon of daughters to
cause her father to forget his bride.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s fair cheeks flushed a little.</p>

<p>“You forget,” he said, “that Neva was my especial
charge from the hour of her mother’s death till I sent
her to that Paris school. My love for you, Octavia, cannot
lessen my love for her. I begin to think that I have
done wrong in not bringing you two together before. I
had a most pathetic letter from Neva before the holidays,
begging to be allowed to come home, but at your
request, Octavia, I denied her natural entreaty and compelled
her to remain at her school. Even Madame <a id="Ref_35" href="#BRef_35">Da-Caret</a>,
the head of the establishment, thought it singular
that Miss Wynde should, alone of all the English pupils,
spend her holidays at the deserted institution. And now
to-day I received a letter from Neva asking if she was to
come home for the Easter holidays. I am afraid I have
not rightly treated my motherless child, Octavia. She
has never seen you; never been at home since you became
mistress here. I fear that the poor child will
think her exile due to your influence, to speak frankly,
dear, and that she will regard you with dislike and bitterness,
instead of the trust and confidence I want her to
feel in you. You are both so dear to me that I shall be
unhappy if you do not love each other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“There is time enough to form the acquaintance after
Neva leaves school,” said Lady Wynde. “She is but a
child yet.”</p>

<p>“She is seventeen years old, Octavia. I have decided
to have her home at Easter, and I hope you will take
some pains to win her trust and affection. She will meet
you half-way, dear.”</p>

<p>“I am not fond of bread-and-butter school-girls,” said
Lady Wynde, half frowning. “The neighborhood will
be agape to see how I play the role of step-mother.
And, to own the truth, Harold, I have no fancy to be
called mother by a tall, overgrown girl, with her hair hanging
down her back in two braids, and her dresses reaching
to her ankles. I shall feel as old as Methuselah.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold sighed, and a grave shadow settled down
upon his square massive brows.</p>

<p>“I hope that Neva will win her way to your heart,
Octavia,” he remarked gently. “I thought it would look
better if my daughter were to call her father’s wife by the
endearing name of mother, but teach her to call you
what you will. I have faith in your goodness of heart,
my wife.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am a little jealous of her,” returned Lady
Wynde, with a forced smile. “You fairly idolize her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have I not made her second to you?” interposed the
baronet. “Has she not been banished from her home to
please you since you entered it? When I think of her
dull, dreary holidays in her school&mdash;holidays! the name
was a mockery&mdash;my soul yearns for my child. Jealous
of her, Octavia? What further proofs do you need that I
prefer my wife in all things above my child?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Lady Wynde tremulously, a hectic flush
burning on either cheek, “look at the magnificent fortune
she will have! While, if you should die I have<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
only the pitiful income of four thousand pounds a year.”</p>

<p>“Pitiful, Octavia!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it <em>is</em> pitiful, compared to Neva’s. You have estates
which you can convey away absolutely by will.
Why should you not make me independently rich, with
property that I can sell if I choose? What you leave to
me is to be mine <em>for life</em>. What you leave to Neva is
hers absolutely. This is monstrous, hateful, unjust!”</p>

<p>The baronet regarded his wife in amazement.</p>

<p>“You were satisfied with your marriage settlements
when they were drawn up, Octavia,” he said.</p>

<p>“I was not satisfied even then, but I had no male relatives
to speak to you about the matter, and it would
have been indelicate for me to have said what I thought.
But I hoped you would make things right in a will, as
you can easily do. It is <em>not</em> right that such a distinction
should be made between a daughter and a wife!”</p>

<p>“I am surprised at you, Octavia,” declared the baronet.
“Neva inherits her mother’s fortune with something
from me, but I cannot undertake to alter my intentions
in regard to her. The provisions that were made for my
mother are the same as those that have been made for
you, and she found them ample. I can promise you
nothing more; but, Octavia,” and he smiled faintly, “I
have no intention of dying soon, and while I live your
income need not to be limited to any certain sum. Let
no jealousy of my Neva warp your noble nature, Octavia.
I shall love you all the better if you love her.”</p>

<p>“Then you decline to make a new will, with further
provision for me?” demanded the wife, her eyes downcast,
the hectic spot burning fiercely on both cheeks.</p>

<p>“You surprise me, Octavia. Why are you so persistent
about a subject of which I never dreamed you even
thought? I <em>do</em> decline to make further provision for you,
but not because I do not love and appreciate you, for I<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
do both. So long as there is no issue to our marriage,
the sum settled on you is ample for your own wants. If
Providence sends us children, they will be provided for
separately. We will let the discussion end here, Octavia,
with the understanding that Neva will spend her
Easter at Hawkhurst.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde compressed her lips and looked sullen,
but, as Sir Harold suggested, the discussion was
dropped. The baronet was troubled, and disappointed in
the wife he had believed faultless. The first shadow of
their married life, the first suspicion of distrust of Lady
Wynde in her husband’s mind had come at last, and they
were hard to bear. Lady Wynde went to the piano and
executed a dashing fantasia, all storm and violence, expressive
of her mental condition. Sir Harold moved
back from the fire and took up a book, but his grave,
saddened face, his steady, intent gaze, and anxious
mouth, showed that he was not reading, and that his
thoughts were sorrowful.</p>

<p>When Lady Wynde had become tired of music, she
went up to her rooms without a word to her husband.
She entered her sitting-room, made beautiful by her husband’s
taste, and going to the fire, knelt down before it
on the hearth-rug. Artress and her maid were neither
of them to be seen, and the baronet’s wife communed in
solitude with her own deformed soul.</p>

<p>The winds tore through the trees in the park and on
the lawn with a melancholy soughing, and the sound
came to the ears of the kneeling woman. Her room was
warm and bright with firelight, lamplight, and the glowing
hue of crimson furniture. Every luxury was gathered
within those walls dedicated to her use. Silken
couches and fauteuils, portfolios of choice engravings,
rare bronzes on the low marble mantel-piece, exquisite
statuettes on carved brackets, albums of scenes in every<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
hand done in water-colors, a beautiful cottage piano, and
a hundred other articles made the room a very temple of
comfort and beauty, yet in the spot where only loving
thoughts of her husband should have had place she
dared to harbor thoughts of crime! And that crime the
most hideous that can be named&mdash;the crime of <em>murder</em>!</p>

<p>While she was kneeling there, the gray companion
stole in softly and silently.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde slowly turned her head, recognized the
intruder, and stared again with wide eyes into the
flames.</p>

<p>“You look like a tragedy queen,” said Artress, with a
soft laugh like the gurgling of waters. “You look as if
you cast away all your scruples, and were ready to carry
out the game.”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Lady Wynde, in a hard, suppressed
voice.</p>

<p>“I thought you would come to it. Will Sir Harold
make a new will?”</p>

<p>“No; he absolutely refuses.”</p>

<p>“Well, four thousand pounds a year need not be despised.
And perhaps,” added Artress significantly, “we
can make the sum larger. Am I to go to town to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the morning train. Go to Craven, and tell
him the phial he gave you is broken and the contents
spilled, and ask him for more of the&mdash;the preparation.
I will find occasion to administer it. I have worked
myself up to the necessary point, and would not scruple
at any crime so long as I need not fear discovery. You
will be back before dinner,” added Lady Wynde, her
brunette complexion turning as gray as that of her companion,
“and to-morrow night at this time I shall be a
widow!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DOOR OPENED TO WICKEDNESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Soon after daybreak, upon the morning following the
occurrence of the incidents related in the preceding
chapter, Lady Wynde’s gray companion departed from
Hawkhurst for Canterbury in a dog-cart which, with its
driver, the baronet’s wife had ordered to be always at
Artress’ disposal. She took the early train up to London,
her business a secret between her mistress and herself.</p>

<p>At the usual breakfast hour, eight o’clock, Lady
Wynde descended to the breakfast room. Sir Harold
was already there, and greeted her with his usual tender
smile, although he looked somewhat careworn. Their
greetings were scarcely over, and the couple had taken
their places at the table, when the butler appeared,
bringing in the morning mail bag.</p>

<p>Sir Harold produced his key and unlocked it. There
were a few newspapers for himself, some packets of silk
samples, and a letter from Madame Elise, her dressmaker,
for Lady Wynde. There were two letters for
the baronet, one quite unimportant, which he tossed
aside. The other bore the Indian post-mark.</p>

<p>“A letter from George,” said Sir Harold, his eyes
brightening. “No, it’s not from George. The address
is not in his hand. Who can have written to me in his
stead?”</p>

<p>He tore open the letter hastily, his countenance falling.</p>

<p>His first glance was at the date; his second at the
signature. An exclamation broke from his lips as he<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
read aloud the name appended to the letter: “Cooper
Graham, Regimental Surgeon.”</p>

<p>“What can this mean?” he exclaimed, in sudden agitation.
“Can George be ill? Octavia, read the letter
to me. The words seem all blurred.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde took the letter, reading it aloud.</p>

<p>It was long, too long to transcribe here, and its import
was terrible to the baronet. It opened with the
announcement that the writer was the surgeon of Captain
Wynde’s regiment, and that Captain Wynde was a
patient under his care. It went on to say that Captain
Wynde was the victim of a terrible and incurable disease
under which he had been suffering for months, and
the surgeon had learned that the poor young man had
not written home to his friends the fact of his peril.
His disease was a cancer, which was preying upon his
vitals. Captain Wynde had been relieved of his regimental
duties, and sent up into the hill country, where
he now was. The young man’s thoughts by day and
night were of his home&mdash;his one longing was to see his
father before he died. Surgeon Graham went on to say
that Captain Wynde could not possibly survive a sea
journey; that he could not bear the bracing sea air, nor
the fatigues of the overland route, and he would assuredly
die on his way home. But, he added, that in
the cool and quiet seclusion of his upcountry bungalow,
his life could probably be prolonged for some three
months.</p>

<p>Surgeon Graham concluded his startling letter with a
further reference to Captain Wynde’s anxiety to look
once more on his father’s face before he died. He said
that the poor young man had desired that the letter
should not be written to Sir Harold, and that the baronet
should be informed of his son’s illness only in the
letter which should announce that son’s death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>This terrible news was a fearful shock to Sir Harold.
His son George, the heir of his name and estates, was
dying in a far, foreign land, with a frightful disease,
with no relative nor friend about him to smooth his
pillow in his last agony, or to wipe the death-damp
from his brows. The father sobbed aloud in his
agony.</p>

<p>“My boy! my poor boy!” he cried, in a broken voice.
“My poor dying boy!”</p>

<p>“It is very sad,” said Lady Wynde, wondering in her
own heart if George Wynde’s death could be made to
benefit her pecuniarily. “The surgeon seems a very
kind-hearted person, and he says that George has an excellent
native nurse, George’s man-servant&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sir Harold interrupted his wife by a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“The man is a Hindoo,” he said. “What consolation
can he offer George in the hour of his death, when his
eyes should rest on a tender, loving face&mdash;when his
dying hands should grasp the hands of a friend? My
poor brave boy! How could I ever consent to his going
out to India? All his bright, military genius, all his
longings to distinguish himself in the army, must end in
an early Indian grave! But he shall not die with not one
of his kindred beside him. We must go to him, Octavia.
We shall reach him in time.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold seized upon his unopened <cite>Times</cite>, and
glanced over the advertisements.</p>

<p>“A steamer sails from Marseilles two days hence,” he
announced. “We must be off to-day, immediately, to
catch it. I will have a bag packed at once. Order your
maid to pack your trunks, Octavia&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, not comprehending the surprised stare in
her ladyship’s bold black eyes.</p>

<p>“You seem to be laboring under a mistake Sir Harold,”<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
said Lady Wynde, coolly. “If you choose to go out
to India, you can do so. George is your son and heir,
and I suppose it would really look better if you were to
go. But as to my hurrying by sea and land, by day
and night, to witness the death of a young man I never
saw, the idea is simply preposterous. My health could
never endure the strain of such a fatigue. You would
have two graves to make instead of one.”</p>

<p>The lines in Sir Harold’s face contracted as in a sudden
spasm.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I was selfish to think of your going, Octavia,” he
said sorrowfully. “It is true that we should have to
travel day and night to reach Marseilles in time to catch
the steamer. The passage of the Red Sea would also be
hard for you. But I was thinking of my poor brave boy
dying there among strangers, with no woman beside
him. If&mdash;if you could have gone to him, my wife, and
let him feel that he was going from one mother here to
another mother <em>there</em>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should like to go, if only my health would permit,”
sighed Lady Wynde. “But why do you not take your
daughter with you?”</p>

<p>The father shook his head.</p>

<p>“She is so young,” he said. “She is so fond of poor
George. I cannot cast so heavy a shadow over her
future life as that visit to her brother’s death-bed would
be. No, Octavia, I will go alone.”</p>

<p>He arose and went out, leaving his breakfast untouched.
Lady Wynde sipped her coffee leisurely, and
ate her breakfast with untroubled appetite. Then she
proceeded to her own private sitting-room and took her
place at one of the windows, watching the whirling
snow-flakes of the February storm.</p>

<p>Sir Harold found her here when he came in, dressed
for his journey. He had ordered a carriage, which was<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
ready. His travelling bag was packed, and had been
taken below. He had come in to say good-bye to his
wife.</p>

<p>“What a great change a single hour has wrought in
our lives!” he said, as he came up to Lady Wynde and
put his arms around her. “Octavia, my darling, it
wrings my heart to leave you. Write to me by every
post. I shall remain with my boy until all is over. Tell
me all the home news. You will have Neva home at
Easter, and love her for my sake! She will be our only
child soon!”</p>

<p>He embraced his wife with passionate affection, and
murmured words of anguished farewell. He tore
himself from her, but at the door he turned back, and
spoke to her with a solemnity she had never seen in him
before.</p>

<p>“Octavia,” he said, “at this moment a strange presentiment
comes over me&mdash;a sudden horror&mdash;a chill as of
death! Perhaps I am to die out there in India! If&mdash;if
anything happens to me, Octavia, promise me to be good
to my Neva.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary to promise,” said Lady Wynde,
“but to please you, I promise!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s keen blue eyes, full of anguish, rested in
a long steady gaze upon that false handsome face, and
the solemnity of his countenance increased.</p>

<p>“You will be Neva’s guardian, if I die,” he said, in a
broken voice. “I trust you absolutely. God do unto
you, Octavia, as you do unto my orphan child!”</p>

<p>How those words rang in the ears of Lady Wynde
long afterward!</p>

<p>Sir Harold gave her a last embrace, and dashed down
the stairs and sprang into the carriage. Lady Wynde
watched him with tearless eyes as he drove down the
avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>When he had disappeared from her sight, she said to
herself:</p>

<p>“Of course I could have done nothing to put an end
to Sir Harold’s life this morning. I only hope he will
die in India&mdash;to save me the trouble of&mdash;of doing anything
when he gets back!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold proceeded to Canterbury with all speed.
On arriving, he proceeded directly to his solicitor’s, had
a new will drawn up, constituting Lady Wynde his
daughter’s personal guardian, and making Neva his sole
heiress in the event of her brother’s death, Lady Wynde
having been sufficiently provided for by her marriage
settlements. The will duly signed and witnessed, Sir
Harold hastened to the station, catching the train for
Dover.</p>

<p>He crossed to Calais by the first boat, and went on to
Marseilles, by way of Paris, without stopping even
to see his daughter. He was not only in time to get
passage by the <em>Messageries Imperiales</em> steamer, but had
an hour to spare. In this hour he wrote a long and very
tender letter to his daughter, telling her of her brother’s
illness, and hinting of the gloom that had settled down
upon his own soul. He begged her if anything happened
to him on this journey, to love her step-mother, and to
obey her in all things, regarding Lady Wynde’s utterances
as if they came from Sir Harold.</p>

<p>He also wrote a note to his wife, and sent the two
ashore to be posted by one of the agents of the company,
just as the vessel weighed anchor for Suez.</p>

<p>In thirty-five days after leaving home he was in the
Indian hill country, and beside his dying son.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde went out very little after her husband’s
departure. She gave no more dinner parties, and behaved
with such admirable discretion that her neighbors
were full of praises of her. Although young, handsome<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
and admired, presiding over one of the finest places in
the county, with no one to direct or thwart her movements,
the most censorious tongue could find nothing to
condemn in her.</p>

<p>The only recreation she allowed herself were her weekly
visits to London, ostensibly to see Madame Elise, but as
the ashen-eyed Artress always accompanied her, they excited
no comment even in her own household.</p>

<p>Easter drew near, and Lady Wynde wrote to her step-daughter
that it would not be convenient to have her at
Hawkhurst during the holidays, and ordered her to remain
at her school.</p>

<p>The spring months passed slowly. Lady Wynde
wrote by every post to her husband, and received letters
as frequently. George’s minutest symptoms were described
to her by the anxious father, and George himself,
looking at his step-mother through his father’s eyes,
sent her loving and pathetic messages, to which she
duly responded.</p>

<p>Thus the time wore on until the midsummer.</p>

<p>About the middle of July, Lady Wynde received a
black-bordered letter from her husband stating that his
son and heir was dead. He had died at his up-country
bungalow, after an illness which had been protracted
considerably beyond the anticipations of his surgeon. Sir
Harold wrote that he was exhausted by long nursing,
and that he should remain a fortnight longer at his son’s
bungalow to recruit his own health, and that he should
then start for home.</p>

<p>“I wish he would come,” said Lady Wynde discontentedly,
to her gray companion. “I am tired of this
dull existence. I am anxious to rid myself of the trammels
of my present marriage, and to be free to marry
again.”</p>

<p>“You can be free within a week after Sir Harold’s return,”<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
said Artress. “And he will be here in September.”</p>

<p>“I shall be free in September,” mused Lady Wynde,
with sparkling eyes. “A widow with four thousand a
year! Ah, if only some good demon would bring about
that happy fact, leaving <em>my</em> hands unstained with crime?”</p>

<p>It seemed as if her familiar demon had anticipated her
prayer.</p>

<p>Some two weeks later, a second black-bordered letter
was brought to Lady Wynde. It was in an unfamiliar
handwriting, and proved to be from Surgeon Graham.</p>

<p>It announced the death of Sir Harold Wynde!</p>

<p>The surgeon stated that the baronet had made all arrangements
for returning to England, and that he had
gone for a last ride among the hills. He had taken a
jungle path, but being well armed and attended by a
Hindoo servant, had anticipated no trouble. Some
hours after he had set out on his ride, about the time the
surgeon looked for his return, the Hindoo servant, covered
with dust, rode up alone in a very panic of terror.
With difficulty he told his story. Sir Harold Wynde had
been attacked by a tiger that had leaped upon him from
the jungle, and before his terrified servant could come
to his aid, he had been dragged from his saddle, with
the life-blood welling from his torn throat and breast.
The servant, appalled, had not dared to fire, knowing
that no human power could help Sir Harold in his extremity,
and the baronet had been killed before his eyes.
The Hindoo had then fled homeward to tell the awful
story.</p>

<p>The surgeon added, that a party had been made up to
visit the scene of the tragedy. A pool of blood, fragments
of Sir Harold’s garments, the bones of his horse,
and the foot-prints of a tiger, all tended to the confirmation
of the Hindoo’s story. A hunt was organized for<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
the tiger, and he was found near the same spot on the
following day and killed.</p>

<p>We have given a brief epitome of the letter that declared
to Lady Wynde that her prayer was answered,
and that she was a widow.</p>

<p>She was sitting in the drawing-room at Hawkhurst
when the letter was brought in to her. She was still sitting
there, the letter lying on her lap, twice read, when
her gray companion stole into the room.</p>

<p>“A letter from Sir Harold, Octavia?” said Artress,
glancing at the black-bordered missive.</p>

<p>“No, it is from that Surgeon Graham,” answered her
ladyship, with an exultant thrill in her low, soft voice.
“You cannot guess the news, Artress. Sir Harold is
dead!”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Lady Wynde, “and I am a widow. Is it
not glorious? A widow, well-jointured and free to marry
again! Ha, ha! Tell the household the sad news, Artress,
and tell them all that I am too overcome with grief
to speak to them. Let the bell at the village be set tolling.
Send a notice of the death to the <cite>Times</cite>. I am a
widow, and the guardian of the heiress of Hawkhurst!
You must write to my step-daughter of her bereavement,
and also drop a note to Craven. A widow, and without
crime. The heiress of Hawkhurst in my hands to do with
as I please! Your future is to be linked with mine, my
young Neva, and a fate your father never destined for
you shall be yours. I stand upon the pinnacle of success
at last.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SETTLING INTO HER PLACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The announcement of Sir Harold Wynde’s death in
India, so soon too after the death of his son and heir, produced
a shock throughout his native county of Kent, and
even throughout England; for, although the baronet had
been no politician, he had been one of the best known
men in the kingdom, and there were many who had known
and esteemed him, who mourned deeply at his tragic
fate.</p>

<p>The London papers, the <cite>Times</cite>, the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, and
others, came out with glowing eulogies of the grand-souled
baronet whose life had been so noble and beneficent.
The local papers of Kent copied these long obituaries,
and added thereto accounts of the pedigree of the
Wynde family, and a description of the young heiress
upon whom, by the untimely deaths of both father and
brother, the great family estates and possessions, all excepting
the bare title, now devolved.</p>

<p>The retainers of the family, the farmers and servants&mdash;those
who had known Sir Harold best&mdash;mourned for him,
refusing to be comforted. They would never know again
a landlord so genial, nor a master so kindly: and although
they hoped for much from his daughter, yet, as
they mournfully said to each other, Miss Neva would
marry some day, and the chances were even that she
would give to Hawkhurst a harsh and tyrannical
master.</p>

<p>The little village of Wyndham, near Hawkhurst, the
very ideal of a Kentish village, had been mostly owned
by Sir Harold Wynde. To him had belonged the row of<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
shops, the old inn with its creaking sign, and most of the
neat houses that stood in gardens along the single street.
It was Sir Harold who had caused to be built the little
new stone church, with its slender spire, and in this
church the mourning villagers gathered to listen to the
sermon that was preached in commemoration of the baronet’s
death.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde was not present to listen to this sermon.
Her gray companion, attired in deep mourning, with the
entire household of Hawkhurst, was there, and the young
clergyman made a feeling allusion to “the bereaved young
widow, sitting alone in her darkened chamber and weeping
for her dead, refusing like Rachel of old, to be comforted.”
Many of the kindly women present shed tears
at this picture, but Artress smiled behind her double
mourning vail. She knew that Lady Wynde was lying
upon a sofa in her luxurious sitting-room at Hawkhurst,
busy with a French novel, and she knew also that not one
tear had dimmed her ladyship’s black eyes since the news
had come of Sir Harold’s horrible fate.</p>

<p>Neighbors and friends thronged to Hawkhurst to offer
their condolences to the young widow. For the first
week she was reported inconsolable, and refused to see
any one; but a box of the most elegant and fashionable
mourning having come down from London, Lady Wynde
began to receive her visitors. She affected to be quite
broken down by her bereavement, and for weeks did not
go out of doors. And when, finally, being urged to take
care of her health and to become resigned to her loss,
she took morning drives, her equipage looked like a
funeral one, her carriage and horses being alike black,
and her own face being shrouded in double folds of
sombre crape.</p>

<p>Artress had written to Sir Harold’s daughter immediately
upon the arrival of the news of Sir Harold’s<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
death, but the letter had been cold and practical, and
contained merely the terrible announcement, without
one line to soften its horror. About a week later, no
letter having been received from Neva, Lady Wynde
wrote a very pathetic letter, full of protestations of sympathy,
and setting forth her own mock sorrow as something
genuinely heart-rending, and declaring herself
utterly prostrated in both body and mind. Her ladyship
offered her condolences to the bereaved daughter,
assuring her that henceforth they “must be all the world
to each other,” and concluded her letter by the false
statement that it had been the late Sir Harold’s wish
that his daughter should remain at her Paris school a
year longer, and, as the wishes of the dead are sacred,
Lady Wynde had sacrificed her own personal feelings in
the matter, and had consented that Neva should remain
another year “under the care of her excellent French
teachers.”</p>

<p>“That disposes of the girl for a year,” commented
Lady Wynde, as she sealed the missive. “I won’t have
her here to spy upon me until the year of mourning is
over, and I am free to do just as I please.”</p>

<p>So the letter was dispatched, and the baronet’s daughter
was condemned to continue her school tasks, even
though her heart might be breaking. There was no
leisure for her in which to weep for the fate of her noble
father; no one who had known him with whom she
might talk of him; and only in the long and lonely
night times was she free to weep for him, and then indeed
her pillow was wetted with her tears.</p>

<p>About three weeks after the receipt of the letter from
India announcing Sir Harold’s death, the baronet’s solicitor
at Canterbury received a note from the widow, requesting
him to call at Hawkhurst on the following day.
He obeyed the summons, bringing with him a copy of<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
Sir Harold’s will, made, as will be remembered, upon
the day of the baronet’s departure from England. Lady
Wynde, clad in the deepest weeds of woe, and attended
by Artress, also in mourning, received the solicitor in
the library, a grand apartment with vaulted ceiling, and
lofty walls lined with books in uniform Russia leather
bindings.</p>

<p>“I have sent for you, Mr. Atkins,” said Lady Wynde,
when the customary greetings had been exchanged, “to
learn if poor Sir Harold left a will. I had his desk
searched, and no document of the sort can be found. If
he made no will, I am anxious to know how I am to be
affected by the omission.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins, a thin, small man, with a large, bald head,
looked surprised at the simple directness of this speech.
He had expected to find her ladyship overcome with
grief, as report portrayed her; but her eyes were as
bright and tearless, her cheeks as red, her features as
composed, as if the business in hand were of the most
trivial and unimportant description. Atkins, who had
appreciated Sir Harold’s grand nature, felt an aversion
to Lady Wynde from this moment.</p>

<p>“She didn’t care for him,” he mentally decided on the
instant. “She’s an arrant humbug, and poor Sir Harold’s
love was wasted on her. Upon my soul, I believe all
she cared about him was for the title and his money.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde’s sharp eyes did not fail to perceive the
unfavorable impression she had made. She bit her lip
fiercely, and her cheeks flushed hotly. Her brows arched
themselves superciliously, and Mr. Atkins, marking her
impatience, hastened to answer:</p>

<p>“Sir Harold left a will, my lady. It was drawn up at
my office at Canterbury upon the day on which he left
England for India. You will remember that he left
Hawkhurst in the morning and drove to Canterbury. He<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
came direct to my office, and dictated and signed his
will. He then proceeded directly to the station and
went by train to Dover, and crossed to Calais. The will
was left in my keeping and is, there can be no question,
the last will and testament of Sir Harold Wynde.”</p>

<p>“I presume no one will care to question the will,” said
Lady Wynde coldly, “although Sir Harold was in a very
excited frame of mind that morning, on account of the
news of his son’s illness, and the pain of leaving his home
and me. Nevertheless, I dare say he was quite competent
to dictate a will. I sent you the particulars of Sir Harold’s
death, with some of the letters detailing the sad
event which I have received from India. There being
no possible doubt of his awful fate, it is time to prove
his will. I wish you to give me some idea of its contents.”</p>

<p>The solicitor drew out a long leathern pocket-book
and took from it a neatly folded paper.</p>

<p>“I have here a copy of the will,” he said briefly. “Is
it your ladyship’s wish to have the will formally read, in
the presence of witnesses?”</p>

<p>“No, that is unnecessary. Leave out the usual useless
preamble and tell me what disposition my husband made
of his property&mdash;the freehold farms, the money in bank,
the consols, the bonds and mortgages? All these he was
free to leave to whom he pleased. I desire to know to
whom he did leave them.”</p>

<p>There was a greediness in the looks and tones of Lady
Wynde that chilled Atkins. In her anxiety to learn the
contents of the will, her ladyship half dropped her mask
and displayed something of her true character, and he
was quick to read it.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold Wynde, in expectation of the death of his
son and heir,” replied Atkins, in his most formal tones,
“bequeathed all the property you have mentioned, all<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
his real and personal property, to his daughter, Miss
Neva Wynde.”</p>

<p>“All to her?” muttered Lady Wynde. “<em>All</em>, you
say?”</p>

<p>“All, my lady. Miss Wynde also inherits Hawkhurst
and the entailed property. She is one of the richest
heiresses in England.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and my name is not mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Sir Harold declares that you are provided for by the
terms of the marriage settlement. You have Wynde
Heights for your dower house and four thousand pounds
a year during your life, with no restrictions in regard to
a second marriage&mdash;a very liberal provision I consider
it.”</p>

<p>“And a very shabby one I consider it,” cried Lady
Wynde, with a black frown. “Sir Harold’s daughter
seventy thousand pounds a year, and I have a paltry
four. It is a shame, a miserable, burning shame!”</p>

<p>“It is unjust, scandalous!” muttered Artress.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold thought the sum sufficient, and I must
say I agree with him,” declared Atkins. “Your ladyship
was contented with the provision at your marriage.
If the allowance was unsatisfactory, why did you not
expostulate with Sir Harold at that time? Why wait
until he is dead to accuse him of injustice?”</p>

<p>“We will not argue the matter,” said Lady Wynde
superciliously. “I shall not contest the will. And now
about my rich young step-daughter. Who are her
appointed guardians?”</p>

<p>There was a perceptible anxiety in her manner, which
Atkins noticed with some wonder. He referred to his
copy of the will, which was open in his hands.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold appointed yourself, my lady, the personal
guardian of his daughter,” he said slowly. “Miss Wynde
is to reside at Hawkhurst under your care until she becomes<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
of age or marries. Upon the occurrence of either
of those events your ladyship is to retire to Wynde
Heights, or to whatsoever place you may prefer, leaving
Miss Wynde absolute mistress of Hawkhurst. Of course
if Miss Wynde desires you to remain after her marriage,
or the attainment of her majority, you are at liberty to
do as you please. I think you comprehend Sir Harold’s
meaning. If it is not precisely clear, I will read the
will&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do not!” interrupted Lady Wynde impatiently. “I
abhor all that tedious phraseology. I understand that
I am Miss Wynde’s sole personal guardian, that I am to
direct her actions, introduce her into society, and that
she is to give me the simple, unhesitating obedience of
a daughter. Is this not so?”</p>

<p>“It is,” assented Atkins, rather hesitatingly. “Sir
Harold expresses the hope that his widow and his daughter
will love each other; and that your ladyship will give
to his orphan child a mother’s tenderness and affection.”</p>

<p>“Sir Harold knew that he could depend upon my
kindness to his child,” said Lady Wynde hypocritically.
“I promised him before he went away to be a mother to
her, although I shall be but a young mother, to be sure.
I shall be very good to the poor girl, whom I love
already. I don’t know anything about law, Mr. Atkins,
but is not some other guardian also necessary&mdash;some one
to see to the property, you know?”</p>

<p>“There are three trustees appointed to look after the
estate during Miss Wynde’s minority,” answered Atkins.
“Sir John Freise is one. You know him well, my lady,
and a more incorruptible, honest-souled gentleman than
he does not exist. He is a man of fine business capacity,
and Sir Harold could not have chosen better. I am also
a trustee, and I can answer for my own probity, and for
my great devotion to the interests of Miss Wynde.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>“And the third trustee&mdash;who is he?”</p>

<p>“The young Earl Towyn. He is the son of one of
Sir Harold’s dearest friends, as you probably know, and
his youth admirably balances Sir John’s age.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde looked thoughtful. Her gray companion
bent over her work, embroidering a black monogram
upon a black-bordered handkerchief, and did not look
up. Her ashen-hued lashes lay on her ashen cheeks, and
she looked dull, spiritless, a mere gray shadow, as we
have called her, but Atkins, studying her face, had an
uncomfortable impression that under all that coldness a
fire was burning.</p>

<p>“She’s more than she looks to be,” he thought keenly.
“I wonder Sir Harold tolerated her in his house. How
singularly she resembles a cat!”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde presently broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I understand the situation of affairs,” she said, “and
I am obliged to you for your prompt attendance upon
my summons, Mr. Atkins. I shall leave my money
affairs in your hands. I desire my jointure to be paid
into the bank and placed to my credit, so that I may
draw upon it when I please. There is nothing more, I
think.”</p>

<p>“I would like to make a few inquiries about Miss
Wynde, if you please, my lady,” said Atkins, with
quiet firmness. “I understand that she is not at home.
Has she not been summoned from her school since her
father’s death?”</p>

<p>“She has not,” answered Lady Wynde haughtily.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madam, but are you not about to summon
her?”</p>

<p>“I am not. Miss Wynde will remain this year at
school. Her studies must be interrupted upon no account
at this time.”</p>

<p>“Not even by her father’s death?” asked Atkins<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
bitterly. “Sir Harold mentioned to me his desire to
have her at home&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sir Harold Wynde is no longer master of Hawkhurst,”
interposed Lady Wynde, with increased superciliousness.
“I believe, by the terms of the will, that I
am mistress here during Neva’s minority. Let me tell
you, Mr. Atkins, that I am my step-daughter’s sole personal
guardian, and that I will submit to no dictation
whatever in my treatment of the girl. If my husband
had sufficient confidence in me to make me his daughter’s
guardian, the trustees whom he himself appointed
have no need nor right to comment upon my actions or
interfere in my plans. Permit me to assure you that I
will brook no interference, and if you try to sow dissension
between Neva and me you are proving unfaithful
to Sir Harold&mdash;as well as oblivious of your own
interests.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins sighed, and murmured an apology. He
soon after took his leave, and drove away in the chaise
in which he had come. His heart was very heavy and
his face overcast as he emerged from the Hawkhurst
grounds into the highway, and journeyed toward Canterbury.</p>

<p>“It was a sorry day for Neva Wynde when her father
died,” he murmured, looking back at the grand old seat&mdash;“a
sorry day! This handsome black-eyed Lady
Wynde, that everybody is praising for an angel of love
and devotion to her husband, is at heart a demon! She
means mischief, though I can’t see how. Poor Neva is
booked for trouble!”</p>

<p>Enough of honest Mr. Atkins’ sentiments had been
apparent in his countenance to prejudice Lady Wynde
against him, and to warn her that he comprehended
something of her real character. As may be supposed,
therefore, she did not again summon him to Hawkhurst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>The days and weeks and months of Lady Wynde’s
widowhood passed on without event. She carried herself
circumspectly in the eyes of the world. No visitors
were invited to Hawkhurst, and her ladyship’s visits to
London were few and far between. She seldom went
to Canterbury, and her drives about the neighborhood
of Hawkhurst were always of the most funereal description,
with black coach, black horses and black attire,
and a slow gait. Her ladyship was found every Sunday
in the baronet’s great square pew in the little Wyndham
church, and as she always sat with the silken curtains
drawn, no one could know that she was not absorbed in
the church services. In short, during the year she had
determined to devote to mourning for her dead husband,
the conduct of Lady Wynde was such as to deepen
her popularity throughout the county. Sir John Freise
enthusiastically declared her an angel, her neighbors
praised her, and only honest Mr. Atkins shook his head
doubtfully when her virtues were lauded, and dared to
suggest that she might not be all she seemed.</p>

<p>The year slowly wore away, and midsummer had
come again. The languor of Lady Wynde’s dull existence
had begun to give place to a strange restlessness.
Her deep mourning had grown odious in her sight, and
was replaced by the lovely combinations of white and
black, the delicate lavenders and soft gray hues which
are supposed to indicate a mitigated grief. The hideous
widow’s cap, not at all becoming to her ladyship, was
exchanged for lavender ribbons in her hair, and jewels
took the place of the orthodox mourning ornaments of
jet. In her “half mourning,” Lady Wynde appeared
more than ever a strikingly handsome woman.</p>

<p>“Artress,” she said one morning to her gray companion,
as she looked out of her sitting-room window
upon the fair domain of Hawkhurst, “this dreaded year<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
is over at last. I have satisfied the demands of society;
I have hoodwinked the jealous and envious eyes of
neighbors, and am free at last. If I were to marry to-morrow,
no one could say that I had not treated the
memory of Sir Harold Wynde with respect. With the
sacrifice of but little over two years of my life, I have
won a fine income, a splendid home during Neva’s minority,
and the guardianship of one of the greatest heiresses
in England. That office is worth three thousand
a year to me while I hold it. Surely I have played my
part well.”</p>

<p>“You have indeed,” echoed Artress.</p>

<p>“Neva must come home soon, but my own business
must be settled before her advent on the scene. I shall
write to Craven immediately. I will have no further
delay.”</p>

<p>She went to a small, beautifully inlaid writing desk,
which stood in a recessed window, and sitting down by
it, wrote upon heavy velvet paper the following words:</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Craven</span>: You may come to me at last. There is no
further obstacle between us.</p>

<p class="center pminus1" style="padding-left:20em">“<span class="smcap">Octavia.</span>”</p>

<p>This brief missive she inclosed in a square envelope,
and stamped with pale green wax and her favorite device.</p>

<p>The letter she addressed to The Hon. Craven Black,
The Albany, London, W.</p>

<p>She then touched her bell. To the servant who came
at her summons she gave the letter, ordering it to be
posted at Wyndham village without delay. When her
messenger had gone, her ladyship gave a sigh of consent,
and murmured:</p>

<p>“I am about to reap the reward of all my schemes.
Craven will be here to-morrow!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HER LADYSHIP’S ACCOMPLICE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The morrow to which Lady Wynde looked forward
with feverish expectation dawned at last, bright and
clear, and deepened into a sultry afternoon. The baronet’s
widow spent hours at her toilet, and the effect of
her labors was satisfactory to her. She surveyed her
reflection in a full-length mirror in her dressing-room
with a smile of complacency. Her black hair was
arranged in braids, curls, and finely crimpled waves,
after the fashion of the day, and in the midst of its prodigal
luxuriance, above her forehead, a jeweled spray
flashed and glittered. Her dress, made low in the neck
and short in the sleeves, to display her finely rounded
shoulders and arms, was of lustrous silk of lavender hue,
and was draped with a black lace overskirt. A necklace
and bracelets incrusted with diamonds added brilliancy
to her appearance. Her liquid black eyes shone and
glittered; her cheeks were red as damask roses; she had
never looked half so handsome in the days when she
had fascinated Sir Harold Wynde and made him adore
her.</p>

<p>She had dismissed her maid, and was giving a last
touch to the short curls that dropped over her forehead,
while she talked with Artress, when wheels were heard
coming up the drive. The gray companion flitted to a
shuttered window and peeped out. A cab was approaching
the house, and a man’s head was protruded from the
window. His face was half averted, as he apparently
studied the exterior of the dwelling, but Artress knew
him. She glided back to Lady Wynde with the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>“He has come!”</p>

<p>A sudden agitation seemed to convulse the soul of the
baronet’s widow. A sudden paleness swept over her
face. She leaned heavily upon the back of a chair, and
stood there motionless until a servant brought up a
silver tray on which lay a large square card with the inscription,
“The Honorable Craven Black,” and announced
that the gentleman had been shown into the
drawing-room. Then her ladyship started abruptly,
the color returning to her face in ruddy waves.</p>

<p>“Come, Artress,” she said, “we will go below. Yet
stay. You may delay your coming for half an hour.
Surely no one can find fault with me for seeing him
alone a little while. Since I became a widow for the
second time, I have felt as if I lived in a glass lantern
with the eyes of all Kent upon me. Yet there is no
need of carrying my caution too far.”</p>

<p>She gave a last glance at her reflection in the mirror, a
last deft touch to her attire, and then swept from the
room down the stairs, and slowly entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>A gentleman within arose from his seat, and came
forward with outstretched hands and eager face. He
was tall, handsome, fair-haired, with light eyes full of
sinister gleams, and his full, sensual lips wore even now
a cynical smile that appeared habitual to them.</p>

<p>He was the same man who had watched, from the
pier head at Brighton, the rescue of Octavia Hathaway
from the sea by Sir Harold Wynde&mdash;the same man who
had witnessed the marriage of the baronet and the
widow from behind a clustered pillar in the church, and
whose sinister comments, as he emerged into Hanover
Square, we have chronicled.</p>

<p>His quick glance swept the form and face of Lady
Wynde; a look of admiration burned in his eyes. He<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
held out his arms. With a joyous cry, the handsome
widow sprang forward, and was clasped in his embrace.</p>

<p>“At last! At last!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Yes, at last!” echoed Mr. Black, in tones of exultation.
“Nothing stands between us now, Octavia! We
have lost nothing by waiting. We have been guilty of
no crime, and fate itself has played into our hands. And
you, Octavia, in the prime of your beauty, are more
magnificent than ever.”</p>

<p>He drew her to a sofa and clasped an arm around her
waist. Her head drooped to his shoulder. The flush of
intense joy mantled her face. With all her soul Lady
Wynde loved this man, and her voice trembled as she
murmured:</p>

<p>“Oh, Craven, I am glad that my life of hypocrisy is
over at last, that there is no longer fear of discovery,
and that we are free to enjoy our reward. How long
ago it seems since you and I formed and entered upon
our conspiracy which has placed me where I am! I
was a widow with a meager income and expensive
tastes. You were a widower with a son to educate, and
a beggarly home and a beggarly income, so that you
could not afford to marry. How well I remember that
night in London, when you told me that if I had courage
and boldness proportionate to my beauty, I could
make our fortunes and our happiness. I eagerly asked
how I could do this, and you showed me a copy of a
Court Journal in which was a paragraph to the effect
that ‘Sir Harold Wynde had gone down to Brighton,
and that his presence there had created quite a flutter
among marriageable ladies.’ And then you told me of
his wealth and generosity, and urged me to try my fascinations
upon him, to win him, to marry him&mdash;and to
succeed in good time to a handsome fortune upon which
you and I could marry. How long ago all that seems!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>“Was it not a clever idea, and cleverly executed?”
said Mr. Black triumphantly. “It was a successful conspiracy,
Octavia, and to you belongs the credit of its
success. You went down to Brighton; you introduced
yourself in a novel manner to Sir Harold Wynde; and
you followed up the acquaintance with such effect that
he offered you marriage. And as that was what you
wanted, you married him. You would have made yourself
a widow, but that fate saved you the trouble. Two
years and six months ago you were a poor widow, unable
to marry me because of our mutual poverty. Now
you are again a widow, rich, respected, honored throughout
Kent, and can marry whom you please. I am as
poor as I was three years ago, and yet, Octavia, I know
that you prefer me to all other men. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde blushed as she murmured assent. She
was essentially bad, being unprincipled and unscrupulous,
but she loved Craven Black with her whole heart,
and with a fervor that astonished herself.</p>

<p>After the death of her first husband, Lady Wynde had
first met Craven Black. They had fallen in love with
each other, as the phrase goes, at their first meeting.
He was a gambler, dissolute&mdash;an adventurer, in fact, although
his respectable birth and connections prevented
the name from attaching to him. He was a widower,
and possessed but a scanty settled income; yet, from
his nefarious gains at the gambling table, and in other
ways, he managed to keep up the appearance of a man
of fashion, to keep a private cab and a tiger, chambers
at the Albany, and to educate his only son, now a man
grown. His gains were, however, precarious, and he
declined entering upon marriage with a person even
poorer than himself.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde, in the days of her first widowhood, had
been but little better than an adventuress. It is true that<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
she had a respectable name, high connections, and a
home in her aunt’s house in Bloomsbury Square; but
she was ambitious of social position, she chafed at her
poverty, and had too much worldly wisdom to marry
Craven Black in the then state of their fortunes, even
had he desired it.</p>

<p>When his fertile brain, therefore, formed a scheme by
which she could enrich them both by imposing upon a
high-minded gentleman, marrying, and then putting him
out of her way as if his life were valueless, she hesitated,
and finally consented. How she had carried out her
share in the foul conspiracy against Sir Harold, the
reader knows.</p>

<p>“Four thousand pounds a year and a good house are
worth serving for,” said Mr. Black meditatively. “I
think, however, that we have waited long enough, Octavia.
When are you going to marry me?”</p>

<p>“Not before September,” declared Lady Wynde decisively.
“I must have a magnificent wardrobe. I am
so tired of dowdy black. And as I shall have to give
up the Wynde family diamonds to the heiress, I must
order some jewels for myself. Let us appoint our marriage
to take place in October. People will talk if it
occurs sooner.”</p>

<p>Craven Black smiled cynically.</p>

<p>“Shall you care what people say?” he inquired. “I
thought you were a law unto yourself.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am not. No woman in the world has a
greater regard for ‘they say’ than I have,” returned
Lady Wynde emphatically. “You see I cannot afford
to turn my back upon Mrs. Grundy. I am ambitious to
be a social leader, and to become so, I must give people
faith in my knowledge of the proprieties of life. I occupy
a high position here as the widow of Sir Harold
Wynde, and he was a sort of idol here, so that, I dare<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
say, people will be jealous of my marrying at all. And
then, again, I desire to gain the love and confidence of
my step-daughter before I remarry. Her guardianship
is worth three thousand a year to me. I shall have
that sum annually as a recompense for chaperoning
her.”</p>

<p>“I would be willing to chaperon several young ladies
on such terms,” said Mr. Black. “How old is she?”</p>

<p>“About eighteen.”</p>

<p>“And how large an income has she?”</p>

<p>“Seventy thousand a year.”</p>

<p>An eager light came into Craven Black’s eyes, and an
eager glow mounted to his fair face.</p>

<p>“A handsome sum,” he ejaculated. “She has a glorious
inheritance. What sort of girl is she?”</p>

<p>“A bread-and-butter school-girl, I suppose. I have
never met her. She was Sir Harold’s idol, and he was
always wanting her to come home, but I did not want
her jealous eyes spying on me, so I contrived to keep
her away. She has not been at Hawkhurst since my
coming.”</p>

<p>“You correspond with her?”</p>

<p>“I write to her now and then, and she sends me a duty
letter, as I call it, once a month. I generally read a line
or two and throw them aside.”</p>

<p>“Has she any love affair?” inquired Mr. Black
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course not. A girl in a French boarding-school
might as well be in a convent, as far as love affairs are
concerned. What are you thinking of, Craven?” and
Lady Wynde looked at him jealously.</p>

<p>The glow on Craven Black’s face deepened, as he
hastened to answer:</p>

<p>“I was thinking what if this girl were to take a liking
to my son Rufus? If we could bring about a marriage<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
between her and Rufus, we should retain her fortune in
the family, and Rufus should agree to allow us ten thousand
a year for using our influence with her. What do
you think?”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde looked startled&mdash;pleased.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” she exclaimed. “I have been
thinking that I should not long be allowed to remain
mistress of Hawkhurst after Neva’s return. An heiress
like her will not want for suitors, and she will marry,
and I cannot prevent it. The proper way is to direct
her marriage for our own benefit. Is Rufus likely to
please a romantic school-girl?”</p>

<p>“I think he cannot fail to please her. He is not yet
one and twenty, well-looking, accomplished, well educated,
rather weak-willed and easily governed, and like
clay in my hands. He has romantic notions about love
and marriage, and if he is on the ground first I am sure
he will win the girl’s heart. I had a quarrel with him
some weeks ago, and he went away from me at my command,
and has taken cheap rooms somewhere and is trying
to live by painting cheap pictures, or some such
thing. I’ll send for him, and have him up at Wyndham
directly.”</p>

<p>“Why did you quarrel with him, Craven? I thought
you were so fond of him.”</p>

<p>“I was&mdash;I am. But he dared oppose his will to mine,
and I turned him adrift, to let him try how he could get
along without me. He is not long out of his university,
and is perfectly helpless about earning money, but he
has some high-flown notions which hardship will cure.
To be frank, our quarrel was about a little music teacher
that the boy thought himself in love with. He has given
her up, and will be glad enough to be summoned to me.
When will Miss Wynde be here?”</p>

<p>“I had a letter to-day from Madame Dalaut, Neva’s<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
preceptress, inquiring my wishes in regard to the girl.
Neva has completed her studies, and Madame Dalaut
insinuates that she ought to be removed from school and
be allowed to enter society. Moreover, the midsummer
holidays have commenced, and the other pupils are gone
to their homes. I have concluded to send Artress over
to Paris to-night to bring Neva home.”</p>

<p>“Do so. My son shall also be at Wyndham to-morrow,
and shall be introduced to the heiress the day after her
return. I will engage rooms for Rufus and myself at
the Wyndham inn, so that I can be near you until our
marriage. Is this plan agreeable to you?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. We must be prompt in our actions.
Neva must become engaged to Rufus before she actually
enters society here. Her marriage can take place at
the same time with our own in October. Elise can do
the two trousseaux at the same time. It is an admirable
plan, and a worthy continuation of our little game.”</p>

<p>They talked further, disclosing to each other their
nefarious plans of self-aggrandizement. Craven Black
talked in lover-like fashion, and even the exacting Lady
Wynde was persuaded that his passion for her had received
a new impulse, and that he loved her as she loved
him&mdash;with an utter devotion.</p>

<p>As the dinner hour drew near Mr. Black took his departure,
not caring to excite the gossip of the household
upon his first visit to Lady Wynde. Directly after
dinner, Artress, attired in gray travelling suit, set out in
a carriage for Canterbury, on her way to Paris, whence
she was to bring to her own home the heiress of Hawkhurst.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA’S FIRST LOVER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The dingy little packet-boat from Calais to Dover,
carrying the mails, bore her usual complement of passengers
upon the bright midsummer day upon which young
Neva Wynde returned after years of absence to her own
country.</p>

<p>A few tall, mustached Frenchmen, with cigars in their
mouths; a German or two with the inevitable pipe; a
few students returning from foreign universities; a few
pedestrian tourists with hobnailed shoes, preposterous
alpenstocks, and a proudly displayed Bradshaw or Murray;
several stout and puffy Englishmen, with singularly
pale faces, and the usual number of rotund ill-dressed
English women, with flimsy muslin dresses and fur
tippets in odd contrast&mdash;a conjunction much affected by
the average British lady&mdash;made up the majority of the
passengers. Some of these people walked about, affecting
to enjoy the fresh breeze; others studied the now
useless guide-book, recalling their adventures; and others
scanned the blue shores of France alternately with the
chalk cliffs of England through the tourist glasses slung
from their shoulders, and wondered aloud if the passage
would be accomplished in the usual ninety minutes.</p>

<p>An odd feature of a Channel packet is the total disregard
of appearances manifested by the passengers
upon it.</p>

<p>Very few, if any, persons go below into the stuffy
little cabins, and doubting souls provide themselves with
ominous white bowls at the outset of the voyage, and
should illness come upon them they proceed to make<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
themselves comfortable upon the deck, or moan, or
swear, according to the sex of the sufferer, totally unmindful
and oblivious of lookers on.</p>

<p>In a corner by herself, at one side of the boat, her
thick green vail over her face shrouding a bowl that
filled her lap, sat Artress, Lady Wynde’s gray companion,
in a condition of abject misery. She had no thought of
any one but herself in that crisis of her physical career,
and gave no heed to her young charge, the one great
desire of her soul being to find herself once more upon
solid land.</p>

<p>At the opposite side of the boat, leaning lightly upon
the rail, and looking back with wistful, longing eyes
upon the fading blue of the French shores, stood a young
girl who was strangely lovely. She was slender and
graceful as a swaying reed, and her lithe, light figure
carried itself with a slight hauteur that was inexpressibly
charming. Her high-bred manner, her evident gentleness
and sweetness, betrayed thorough culture of heart
and mind. Her face was a rare poem. The features
were slightly irregular, and even in repose, with a grave
shadow upon her fair brows, her countenance had a
bright, piquant witchery. Her complexion was very
pure and fair, her lips a vivid scarlet, and under her
broad forehead a pair of wondrous red-brown eyes
sparkled and glowed with strange brilliancy. Her hair,
very abundant, and of a reddish-brown tint as rare as
beautiful, was gathered into braids at the back of her
small, noble head.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a traveling suit of black cashmere,
and wore a black hat surmounted with a scarlet wing.</p>

<p>She was Neva Wynde, the owner of Hawkhurst, one
of the greatest heiresses in England, and now the object of
the sinister machinations of her handsome step-mother
and Craven Black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>Her school-days were over, and she was on her way to
a home she had not visited for years, and to a guardian
whom she did not know, and who was secretly her enemy.
She had emerged from the pleasant security of the school-room
into a region of perils. A premonition of the
dangers before her seemed almost to come upon her now,
and into her glowing eyes crept a look of sorrowful
yearning, and of passionate protest against the friendlessness
of her lot.</p>

<p>A few feet distant from her, also leaning upon the railing,
stood a young man, whose gaze, ostensibly fixed
upon the French coast, now and then rested upon the
girl’s speaking face with an expression of keen admiration
and interest. He thought in his own soul that he
had never seen a being so fresh, so dainty, so pure, so
rarely beautiful. She seemed utterly alone. No one inquired
how she felt, nor offered her a seat, nor looked
after her, and her young admirer wondered if she were
all alone in the world, as she seemed.</p>

<p>He was speculating upon the subject when a sudden
lurch of the boat upon the short, chopping Channel
waves, caused Neva to involuntarily loosen her hold upon
the railing, and pitched her abruptly along the deck
toward him. He sprang forward and caught her in his
arms. She recovered her equilibrium upon the instant,
and again grasped the railing, blushing, confused, and
murmuring her thanks for his civility.</p>

<p>“The Channel is rough to-day,” remarked the young
gentleman. “Shall I not find you a seat?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” returned Neva, in her sweet, low,
cultured voice. “I prefer standing.”</p>

<p>The words were simple enough, and her manner was
quiet and reserved, but her voice went to the young
man’s heart, thrilling it with a strange sensation. He did<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
not attempt a retreat, and Neva looked up at him with
something of surprise in her glorious red-brown eyes.</p>

<p>As he encountered her full gaze, his face flushed, his
eyes glowed, and a warm smile curved his mouth.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, “but are you not Miss
Wynde of Hawkhurst?”</p>

<p>Neva bowed assent, with an increasing surprise.</p>

<p>“I was sure, when I met your full glance, that you
were Neva Wynde,” cried the young gentleman. “You
do not remember me, I see; and yet, when you went
away to that odious Paris school you and I parted with
tears, and you promised to be true to me, little Neva.
And you have forgotten me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried the young girl, an answering glow in
her face, and her eyes shining like suns. “Is it really
you, Arthur? How you have changed!”</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him, and he clasped it with
a warm, lingering pressure. Her eyes scanned his face
in an earnest scrutiny, and she blushed again when she
saw how handsome he was, and how like he was to an
ideal she had long cherished in the very depths of her
young soul.</p>

<p>He was fair, with warm blue eyes, golden hair, and a
mustache of tawny gold. He had a frank, noble face,
and his sunny eyes betrayed a generous soul. One who
ran might read in his countenance a brave, dauntless
soul, a grand, unselfish nature, an enlightened spirit,
quick sympathies, and an honest, truthful, resolute character.
Neva thought, as she shyly regarded him, that
he was very like a hero of romance.</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe that it is Arthur,” she said, smiling,
her face softly flushing. “You are not at all like
the Arthur Towyn I knew, and yet I can see the old
boyish gayety and brightness of spirit. Your mustache
has changed your looks greatly, Lord Towyn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>“It makes me look older perhaps,” said Lord Towyn
gravely, “and as I am but three and twenty, and have a
ward who is eighteen years old, it becomes me to produce
as venerable an appearance as possible. Of course
you are aware Neva, that I am one of the three trustees
or guardians of your entire property, appointed by your
father in his will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew it a year ago,” replied Neva, the brightness
fading a little from her face. “Mr. Atkins wrote
me about papa’s will. Mr. Atkins and Sir John Freise
are the two other executors. You are very young for
such an appointment, are you not, Lord Towyn?”</p>

<p>“That is a fault that time will mend,” said his lordship,
smiling. “I am young for the post, but Sir Harold
Wynde knew that he could trust me, especially with two
older heads to direct me. I am only the least of three,
you know, and my youth was meant to balance Sir John
Freise’s age. Your school life is over, is it not, Miss
Wynde?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is over,” and Neva sighed. “I am on my way
to a new sort of life, and to new acquaintances and
friends. I feel a sort of terror of my future, Lord
Towyn. I am foolish, I know, but a dread comes over
me when I look forward to going home. Home! Ah,
all that made the old house home has vanished. My poor
brother George lies in an Indian grave. Papa&mdash;poor
papa&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice broke down, and she averted her head.</p>

<p>Young Lord Towyn came nearer to her. He longed
to press her hand and to offer her his sympathy. He
comprehended her desolation, and the unhealed wound
caused by Sir Harold’s fate. His heart bled for her.</p>

<p>He had known Neva Wynde from her earliest childhood.
They had played together in the woods and gardens
of Hawkhurst and before Neva had been sent to<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
her foreign school the child pair had betrothed themselves
and vowed an eternal fidelity to each other. The
late Earl Towyn, the father of Arthur, and Sir Harold
Wynde had been college-mates, and it had been their
dearest wish to unite their families in the persons of
their children, but they had been too wise to broach the
idea to the young couple. They had, however, encouraged
the affection of Arthur and Neva for each other,
and had looked forward hopefully to the time when that
childish affection should possibly ripen into the love of
manhood and womanhood. Soon after Neva’s departure
for school Lord Towyn had died, and his son, then at
college, had become earl in his stead. A mysterious
fate had also removed Sir Harold Wynde, and Neva’s
step-mother, as is known to the reader, had schemes of
her own in regard to Neva’s marriage.</p>

<p>The young earl’s mute sympathy seemed to penetrate
to Neva’s heart, for presently she turned her face again
to him, and although her mouth quivered her eyes were
brave, as she said brokenly:</p>

<p>“You will think me unchristian, Lord Towyn, but I
cannot become reconciled to the manner of papa’s death.
If he had but died as George died, peacefully in his bed;
but his fate was so horrible&mdash;so awful! I sometimes
fancy in the night that I can hear his cries and moans.
In my own imagination I have witnessed his awful death
a thousand times. The horror of it is as fresh to me
now as when the news first came. Shall I ever get used
to my sorrow? Will the time ever come, do you think,
when I can think of papa with the calmness and resignation
with which I think of my poor brother?”</p>

<p>“It was horrible, even to me, beyond all words to describe,”
said the young earl softly. “I loved Sir Harold
only less than my own father, and I have mourned
for him as if I had been his son. All ordinary words of<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
consolation seem a mockery to one who mourns a friend
who perished as he did. He was vigorous and young
for his years, noble and true and good. Let us hope
that his pangs and terrors were but brief, Neva. Perhaps
his death was not so terrible to him as it seems to
us. It were better so to die than to languish for years
a prey to some excruciating disease. And let us remember
‘whatever is, is right.’ Instead of dwelling on
the manner of his death, let us remember that his death
was but the opening to him of the gates of life eternal.”</p>

<p>Neva did not answer, but her face was very grave and
tender, and her sun-like eyes glowed with a softer radiance.
There was a brief silence between them, and
finally Neva said, with an abrupt change of the subject:</p>

<p>“Do you know Lady Wynde, Lord Towyn?”</p>

<p>“I have met her several times, but not since Sir
Harold’s death,” was the reply. “Is she traveling with
you?” and the young earl glanced around the deck.</p>

<p>“No, she sent her companion for me. That is Artress,
on the other side of the boat. I have never seen Lady
Wynde.”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn looked his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Have you not been home since your father’s marriage,
nor since his death, Miss Wynde?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. Papa came once to see me at my school after
his marriage, but he did not bring his wife. I have a
picture of her which papa sent me. He must have
adored her. His letters were full of loving praises of
her, and in the last letter he wrote he told me that he
desired me to love and obey her as if she were my own
mother. His wishes are sacred to me now, and I shall
try to love her. Is she very handsome?”</p>

<p>“She is considered handsome,” replied Lord Towyn.
“She is dark almost to swarthiness, and has a gypsy’s
black eyes. Sir Harold almost worshiped her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Then she must be good?”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn hesitated. He knew little of the handsome
Lady Wynde, but he had an instinctive distrust of
her.</p>

<p>“She must be good,” he answered thoughtfully.
“Had she not been good, Sir Harold would not have
loved her.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I have thought that a hundred times,” said
Neva. “I shall try to win her love. She is to stay at
Hawkhurst as my personal guardian during my minority,
and there can be no indifference between us. It
must be peace or war. I intend it shall be peace. You
see, Lord Towyn, that I shall be almost completely dependent
upon her for society and friendship. I am
coming back a stranger to my childhood’s home. Years
of absence have estranged me from the friends I knew,
and I have no one outside of Hawkhurst to look to, save
Mr. Atkins and Sir John Freise.”</p>

<p>“And me,” said Lord Towyn earnestly. “I am associated
with them, you know. But you will not be so
utterly friendless as you think. The old county families
will hasten to call upon you, and you can select
your own friends among them. The Lady of Hawkhurst
will be feted and welcomed, and made much of.
Your trouble will soon be that you will have no time to
yourself. I desire to add myself to your list of visitors.
I am staying this summer at a place of mine on the
Kentish coast. But here is the Dover pier straight
ahead, Miss Wynde. We have made the voyage in good
time, despite the roughness of the Channel.”</p>

<p>There was no time for further conversation. The suggestive
bowls were being hidden under benches by the
late sufferers, and bundles, boxes and bags were being
sought after with reviving energies. Artress arose,
found her traveling bag and umbrellas, and then sought<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
for her charge. As her gaze encountered Neva’s piquant
face upturned to the admiring glances of a handsome
young gentleman, she looked shocked and horrified, and
her sharp, ashen-hued features became vinegary in their
expression. She approached the young lady with unseemly
haste, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde, I am surprised&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Neva, quietly interposing, although
her face flushed haughtily, “but I desire to introduce
to you, Mrs. Artress, my old friend Lord Towyn.”</p>

<p>The young earl bowed, and Mrs. Artress did the same,
divided between her desire to be polite to a nobleman
and her anger that Neva should have renewed his acquaintance
while under her charge. Artress was deep
in the confidence of Lady Wynde and Craven Black, and
her interests were identical with theirs. She had a keen
scent for danger, and in the attitude of Lord Towyn toward
Neva she recognized an admiration which might
easily deepen into love.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear,” said Mrs. Artress anxiously. “The
boat is at the pier, and we must hasten ashore. Give
me your dressing bag&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused, seeing that Lord Towyn had already possessed
himself of it. The young earl offered his arm to
Neva, and she placed her hand lightly upon it, and was
conducted along the boat to the place of landing. Mrs.
Artress followed, biting her lips with chagrin.</p>

<p>The landing and examination of baggage were duly
accomplished, and Lord Towyn conducted his charges
to a first-class coach of the waiting train, seated them,
and took his place beside Neva.</p>

<p>“Are you going to Hawkhurst also, my lord?” inquired
Mrs. Artress sourly, as he fed the guard handsomely,
in order that no other travelers might be ushered
into their compartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>“No, madam, not to-day,” answered the young earl
pleasantly. “I am on my way to Canterbury to consult
with Sir John Freise and Mr. Atkins concerning
some business relative to the Hawkhurst property, and I
shall probably do myself the honor to call with them
upon Miss Wynde in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Lady Wynde will be happy to see you and to consult
with you,” said Mrs. Artress, with ill-concealed
annoyance. “Miss Wynde is too young, I should judge,
to understand anything about business. Besides, her
friends should spare her all trouble of that description.”</p>

<p>“I shall be always ready to consult with you about
business, Lord Towyn,” said Neva in her clear, low voice.
“I desire to fit myself for my position as owner and dispenser
of a large income. I regard the money intrusted
to me as a talent for which I shall be called to account,
and I want to learn to manage my affairs properly, and
with prudence and discretion. I think,” she added
lightly, “that I shall take Miss Burdett Coutts as my exemplar
in this matter. She is a business woman, I understand,
and I should like to be like her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Artress was silenced, but she thought within
herself:</p>

<p>“Our young lady has opinions of her own, and has the
courage to express them. I am afraid that she is not the
bread and butter school-girl we expected. I am afraid
that we shall have trouble with her.”</p>

<p>The journey to Canterbury was accomplished only too
quickly for Lord Towyn and Neva. They talked of their
childhood, but no allusion was made to their childish betrothal,
although both doubtless thought of it. The
young earl explained that he had been over to Brussels
for a week, and had no thought of meeting her on his
way home, and his face as well as his tones told how glad
he was of that meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>The Hawkhurst carriage with its liveried servants was
in waiting at the Canterbury station when they alighted.
Lord Towyn assisted the ladies into the vehicle, bade
them adieu, and as they drove away followed them with
a lingering gaze.</p>

<p>“How beautiful Neva is!” he murmured to himself.
“And so pure and sweet and tender, yet spirited! I wonder
if she remembers our childish betrothal? I don’t like
that Artress, and I do not quite like Lady Wynde. I
hardly think Neva will be happy with her, their natures
being so dissimilar. I must go out to Hawkhurst to-morrow,
and judge whether they are likely to get on together.
If Neva does not like her step-mother, she has
but one avenue of escape from her dominion before she
becomes of age, and that avenue is marriage. If she
would only marry me. I love her already. Love her! I
could adore her.”</p>

<p>A passionate flush arose to his fair cheek, and a tender
glowing light to his warm blue eyes, and he descended
the steps and strode out of the station, his heart thrilling
with the strange and new sensation which he now knew
was love. And as he walked along the street, he vowed
within himself that he would woo and, if he could, would
win young Neva Wynde to be his wife.</p>

<p>Ah, he little knew the gulfs that would arise between
him and her&mdash;the dangers, the perils, the sorrows, they
two must taste. And even as he strode along, acknowledging
to his own soul that he was Neva’s lover, Neva
was speeding across the pleasant country toward the
home where her enemy awaited her with schemes perfected,
and an evil heart hidden under a smiling face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE SON OF THE HONORABLE CRAVEN BLACK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Upon the morning of the day on which Neva Wynde
and Lord Towyn so strangely encountered each other
upon the dingy packet-boat&mdash;an encounter that was destined
to be fateful&mdash;a scene transpired in one of the London
suburbs to which we would call the attention of the
reader.</p>

<p>In an upper room, in one of the dingiest houses of one
of the dingiest crescents at New Brompton, a young man,
a mere youth, was engaged in painting a picture. The
room was bare and comfortless, with threadbare carpet,
decrepit and worn-out furniture, and springless sofa-bed&mdash;one
of the poorest rooms, in fact, a lodging-house of
the fourth rate can furnish. There were two windows
without curtains, and provided only with torn and faded
blue paper shades, rolled up and confined with cotton
cord. A few ashes were in the grate, showing that although
the season was summer, a fire had lately burned
there.</p>

<p>The picture which the youth was painting stood upon
an easel before one of the windows, and was but little
better than a daub. It had been sketched by a bold and
vigorous hand, but was faulty in conception and ill-colored.
The light upon it was bad, and the hand that
wielded the brush was trembling and impatient, weakened
by fasting and emotions.</p>

<p>The painter looked a mere boy, although he was full
twenty years of age. His complexion was florid, his
eyes hazel in hue, and he wore his brown hair long, artist
fashion, and tossed back from his high white forehead.<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
He was handsome, with an honest look in his eyes, and
a pleasant mouth, but his chin was short, and weak in
its expression, and his countenance betrayed a character
full of good and noble impulses, yet with a weakness,
indecision, and irresolution that might yet prove fatal to
him.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a shabby velveteen jacket, daubed
with paints and out at the elbows. His garments, like
his lodging, betrayed poverty of the most unmitigated
description.</p>

<p>This young man was Rufus Black, the only son of
Craven Black who was Lady Wynde’s lover. And it
was Rufus Black whom his father and Lady Wynde had
planned should marry Neva Wynde, and thus play into
their hands, enabling them to possess themselves of a
portion of Neva’s noble fortune.</p>

<p>As Mr. Black had said, he had quarrelled with his son
some weeks before, and cast him off, penniless and destitute
of friends, to shift for himself. He had drifted to
his present lodgings, and was trying to keep soul and
body together by painting wretched pictures, which he
sold to a general dealer for wretched pay.</p>

<p>“The picture don’t suit me,” he said, pushing back his
chair, that he might get a better view of the painting.
“It’s only a daub, but it’s as good as the pay. I’ve been
three days at it, and it won’t bring me in even the fifteen
shillings I got for the last. It will do to stop up a
chimney-place, I suppose&mdash;and I had such grand ideas
of my art, and of my talents! I meant to achieve fame
and fortune, and here I am without food or fuel, with
the rent due, and with my soul so fettered by these cares,
so borne down by despair and remorse, that I am incapable
of work. I am gone to the dogs, as my father
told me to go&mdash;but, oh, why did I not travel the downward<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
road alone? Why must I drag <em>her</em> down with
me?”</p>

<p>A despairing look gathered on his face; the tears filled
his eyes; a sob escaped him. He looked haggard, worn
and despairing. He was in no condition for work, yet
he resumed his task with blinded eyes, and painted on
at random with feverish haste.</p>

<p>He had grown somewhat calmer, with the calmness of
an utter despair, when the door opened, and a girl came
in bearing a large basket heavily loaded. She was a
slender young creature, not more than seventeen years
old, and her pale face and narrow chest betrayed a tendency
to consumption. Her complexion was of a clear
olive tint; her hair was of a blue-black color, and was
worn in braids; her eyes were dark and loving, with an
appealing expression in them; and, despite the circumstances
of her lot, she maintained a hopeful, sunshiny
spirit and a sunshiny countenance.</p>

<p>She was the young music-teacher for whose sake Rufus
Black had quarrelled with his father. She was the
last member of a large family who had all died of consumption.
She had lost her situation in a ladies’ school
about the time that Rufus had separated himself from
his father; and after the young man had abandoned his
parent, he had hastened to her and begged her to marry
him. He was full of hope, ambitious, determined to
achieve fame and fortune by his painter’s brush, and she
was weak and worn, sorrowful and nearly ill, and quite
penniless. Believing in his talents and ability to support
them both, she had accepted the refuge he offered
her, and one week after Craven Black had turned his
son adrift, the young pair were married, and moved into
their present dingy quarters.</p>

<p>They had joined their poverty together, and soon discovered
that the achievement of fame and wealth was<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
uphill work. Rufus was fresh from his university,
unused to work for his bread, and he had overrated his
talent for painting, as he presently discovered. He found
it hard work to sell his poor efforts, and he could not
paint enough at first to bring him in twenty shillings a
week. It was now three months since his marriage, and
one by one his books, his better articles of clothing, his
watch, and other trinkets, had been sold or pledged to
buy necessaries or pay the rent. Upon this morning
they had had no breakfast.</p>

<p>“How big your eyes are, Rufus!” laughed the young
wife, throwing off her battered little hat. “You look as
if I had brought you some priceless treasure; but you
well may, for I have the nicest little breakfast we have
had for a week.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” inquired the young artist,
his thin cheeks flushing with an eagerness he would
have concealed. “Have you prevailed on the grocer to
give us credit?”</p>

<p>“No, I could not do that,” and the young wife shook
her head. “I’m afraid his heart is as hard as the nether
mill-stone we read about. He thinks I’m a humbug&mdash;a
cheat! But our landlady, Mrs. McKellar, you know, has
faith in your picture, and I borrowed two shillings of
her. See what a sumptuous repast we shall have,” and
she proceeded to display the contents of her basket,
unpacking them swiftly. “Here’s two-pence worth of
coffee, a pennyworth of milk, a threepenny loaf, and a
superb rasher of ham of the kind described by the Irishman
as ‘a strake of fat and a strake of lane.’ And here’s
a bundle of wood to boil the coffee; and I’ve gone to
the extravagance of a sixpenny pot of jam, your appetite
is so delicate. And now for breakfast.”</p>

<p>She piled her wood skillfully in the grate, put on her
coffee-pot and frying pan, and lighted her fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>Then while her breakfast was cooking, she laid her
table with her scanty ware, and bustled about like an
incarnate sunbeam, and no one would have suspected
that she too was weak and hungry, and that she was
sick at heart and full of dread for the future.</p>

<p>“So breakfast is provided for,” murmured Rufus
Black, in a tone in which it would have been hard to
tell which predominated, relief or bitterness. “I began
to fear we should fast to-day, as we did yesterday.”</p>

<p>The young wife turned her rasher of ham in the pan,
and put her small allowance of coffee in the pot, before
she answered gravely:</p>

<p>“Rufus, I think I might get another situation to teach
music. I have good references, you know. I don’t like
being so utterly dependent upon you. You have not
been used to work. I’m afraid we did very wrong in
getting married.”</p>

<p>“What else could we do?” demanded Rufus Black.
“I could not see you working yourself to death, Lally,
when a little care would save you. You had to go out
of doors in all weathers, and you were going into a galloping
consumption. I expected to be able to support
you, but I’m only a useless fellow, after all. I thought I
had talent, but it has turned out like the fairy money&mdash;it
has turned to dead leaves at the moment of using it.
I have a university education, and would be thankful
for a situation as usher in a dame’s school. I am willing
to dig ditches, only I’m not strong enough. Oh,
Lally, little wife, what is to become of us?”</p>

<p>Lally Black&mdash;she had been christened Lalla by her
romantic mother, after the heroine of Moore’s poem, but
her name had lost its romantic sound through years of
every-day use&mdash;approached her young husband, and
softly laid her cheek against his. She stroked his hand
gently as she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>“It is I who am useless, Rufus. You ought to have
married a rich wife instead of a poor little music-teacher.
I’m afraid you’ll reproach me in your heart some day
for marrying you&mdash;there, there, dear boy! I did not
mean it. I know you will never regret our marriage, let
what will be the result!”</p>

<p>She caressed him tenderly, and then hurried to the fire
intent upon her breakfast. The coffee was steaming,
and the ham was cooked. The busy little housewife
made a round of toast, and then announced that breakfast
was ready. Rufus drew up his chair to the table,
and Lally waited upon him, and was so gay and bright
and hopeful that he became infected with her spirit.</p>

<p>But when the delicious breakfast was over he became
grave and haggard again, and bowed his face on his
hand and sat in silence, while she washed the dishes and
carefully put away the remnants of the meal. Then she
came to him and sat on his knee, and drew his hand
from his face, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Rufus, is your father rich?”</p>

<p>“He has some three or four hundred pounds a year&mdash;that’s
all,” answered Rufus. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Could he not assist us a little, if he wished?” ventured
Lally. “I have no relative to apply to. I had a
great-aunt who married a rich man, and I think she
lives in London, but I don’t know her name, and she
probably never heard of me, so I can’t write or go to
her. Let us humble ourselves to your father, dear&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To what purpose?” interposed Rufus half fiercely.
“My father is a mercenary, villainous&mdash;Don’t stop me,
Lally. I am telling the truth, if he <em>is</em> my father. Thank
God, I took after my poor mother. My father does not
know we are married, and I dare not tell him. If I fear
anybody in this world, I fear my father.”</p>

<p>“But he must know some time of our marriage,”<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
urged the young wife. “You make me afraid, dear, that
we did wrong in marrying. We are too young, and I had
to work for my living. Your father could never forgive
me, and accept me as his daughter. My family is of no
account, and yours is good. People think of all these
things, and you will be looked down upon for your unfortunate,
ill-starred marriage. Oh, Rufus, if we could
undo what we have done, it might be well for us.”</p>

<p>The young husband endeavored to console his wife,
and he had brought back her bright hopefulness, when
the postman’s knock was heard on the street door. A
sudden hope thrilled them both. They listened breathlessly,
and not in vain. Presently the housemaid’s heavy
tread was heard on the stairs, and she entered the room,
bringing a letter.</p>

<p>When she had departed, Rufus opened the letter, and
the young couple perused it together. It was dated
Wyndham village, and had been written by Craven
Black, and contained simply an announcement that the
father desired to be reconciled to his son; that he saw
a way in which he could make Rufus a rich man; and
he begged his son, if he also desired a reconciliation and
wealth, and was willing to submit himself to his father’s
will, to come to him at once by the earliest train. Between
the leaves of the letter was a ten-pound note.</p>

<p>“You will go, of course?” cried the young wife
excitedly.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what he meant,” muttered Rufus
irresolutely.</p>

<p>“He is your father, dear, and you will go,” urged
Lally. “For my sake, you will go. And Rufus, I beg
you to yield to his wishes. They will not be unreasonable,
I am sure. Say you will go!”</p>

<p>Rufus hesitated. He knew that when with his father,
he was a coward without a will of his own. What if he<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
should be driven into some act he should hereafter repent?
Yet at last he consented to go to his father, and
an hour later he divided his money with his wife, giving
her the larger share, and took his departure. At that
last moment a horrible misgiving came over him, and
he ran back and kissed the little sunshiny face he loved,
and then he went out again and made his way to the
station, with a death-like pall upon his soul.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A KNOT SUMMARILY SEVERED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Rufus Black’s heart grew heavier still, and his sense
of dread deepened, as he steamed down to Canterbury
in the express train. He had a seat by a window in a
second-class compartment in which were four other passengers,
but he was as much alone as if he had had the
compartment to himself. His travelling companions
chatted and laughed and jested among themselves, while
he looked from his window upon hop-gardens, green
fields, and clustering hamlets, with sad, unseeing eyes,
and thought of his poverty, his friendlessness, and the
slow starvation that lay before him and his young wife.</p>

<p>“I could bear it for myself,” he thought bitterly.
“But it is hard to see Lally suffer, and I know she does
suffer, although she seems so light-hearted and brave.
My poor little wife! Ah, what place have I in the
world of gay idlers and strong workers? I am neither
the one nor the other. What is to be the end of it
all?”</p>

<p>He looked enviously at the workers in a brick-yard<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
the train was passing at that moment. There were men
there, coarse and ignorant, but brawny of limb and
broad of chest; and there were children too, boys and
girls of tender years, working steadily for scanty pay;
but they were all workers, and they looked stolidly contented
with their lot.</p>

<p>“With all my university education,” thought the boy
artist bitterly, “I am less capable of self-support than
those ignorant brick-makers. Why did my father bring
me up with expensive tastes and like the heir of fine estates,
only to cast me off to starve at the first moment
I displeased him? What is the empty name of gentleman
worth, if one cannot keep it and be a worker? If
he had put me to some trade, I should not have been
half so miserable to-day. I am only twenty years old,
and my life is a failure at the outset.”</p>

<p>The train swept on through new scenes, and the
course of the young man’s musings was changed, but
their bitterness remained in full strength.</p>

<p>“I wonder what my father can want of me,” he said
to himself presently. “How can he put me in the way
of a fortune? He promised that I should study law,
but he has forgotten the promise. With a profession to
depend upon, I know I could win a competence. Perhaps
it is to speak of this he has sent for me this morning.
He surely cannot mean for me,” and the young
man’s brow darkened, “to become a gambler, as he has
been? I shall refuse, if he proposes it. For my innocent
Lally’s sake, I will keep myself pure of his vices.”</p>

<p>This resolution was strong within him when he
alighted from the train at Canterbury and took a hansom
cab to Wyndham village. The drive of several
miles was occupied with speculations as to what his
father wanted of him, and with thoughts of his young
wife in her dingy lodgings at New Brompton, and he<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
did not even notice the houses, farms and villas they
passed, nor any feature of the scenery, until the horse
slackened his speed to a walk, and the driver opened
his small trap in the roof, and said:</p>

<p>“The house yonder on the ridge, sir, is Hawkhurst,
the seat of the Wynde family. Sir Harold Wynde died
in India a year ago, you know, sir, and the property belongs
to his only child, a daughter. A mile or so beyond
is Wyndham village.”</p>

<p>Rufus Black turned his gaze upon the fair domain of
the Wyndes. It lay on both sides of the highway,
stretching as far as his eye could reach. The grand old
mansion of gray stone, with outlying houses of glass
glittering in the summer sunshine like immense jewels,
the great lawns, the gardens, the park, the cool woods,
all these made up one of the fairest pictures the eyes of
Rufus Black had ever rested upon.</p>

<p>“How glorious!” he said involuntarily. “And it all
belongs to a lady!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a mere girl,” replied the cabman. “She is
at school in France. It’s a great place, is Hawkhurst.”</p>

<p>He dropped the trap and urged on his horse, but
Rufus continued to look upon the house and estate with
great, envious eyes. Why should all this belong to one,
and that one a mere girl, while he wanted for bread?
His soul was convulsed with bitterness and repining,
and the shadow of his trouble rested upon his face.</p>

<p>A few minutes of brisk driving brought them to Wyndham
village, which consisted merely of one long straggling
street, lined with houses and gardens. In the
very centre of the street, upon four corners formed by
the intersection of a country road, was gathered the
business portion of the hamlet. Upon the corner was
the village smithy, from whose open door came the ringing
sound of hammer upon anvil. A group of countrymen<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
were gathered about the door of the smithy, and a
few carts stood before it on the paved street. Upon a
second corner was a general shop and postoffice in one.
Upon a third corner was a rival establishment, of the
same description, but without the advantage and prestige
of the postoffice, and on the fourth corner stood the
Wyndham Inn, with its swinging sign, ample court-yard
and hospitable look.</p>

<p>It was an old stone building, with a wide portico in
front, on which were tables and chairs. Rufus Black
was driven into the court, and sprang out of the cab, at
the same moment that the portly, rubicund landlord
came out to receive him. The young man inquired for
his father, and was informed that he was in his rooms at
the inn. Rufus paid and dismissed the cabman, and
followed the landlord into the inn.</p>

<p>He was conducted up a flight of uncarpeted stairs,
and the landlord pointed out to him the door of a front
chamber as the one at which he was to knock. Rufus
quietly lifted the latch and ushered himself into the
room, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>The room was a pleasant little country parlor, with
three casement windows, a faded carpet on the floor,
cane-seated furniture, and a jug of flowers on the mantel-shelf.
The sunlight streamed in, but its heat was tempered
by the delicious breeze. The Honorable Craven
Black was not in the room, but there were vestiges of
his occupancy on every side. Upon a small table stood
his massive dressing case with mirror and brushes
mounted in exquisitely carved ivory, and with boxes and
bottle-stoppers of finely chased and solid gold. All the
appointments of the large case were luxurious in the
extreme, and Rufus thought bitterly that the sum which
that Sybaritic affair had cost would be a fortune to him
in his own present destitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>A beautiful inlaid writing case, a tobacco jar of the
finest Sevres porcelain, a Turkish pipe mounted in gold
and amber, a liqueur case, and various other costly
trifles, were scattered lavishly about. The Honorable
Craven Black had never denied himself a luxury in his
life, and these things he carried with him wherever he
went, as necessary to his comfort and happiness.</p>

<p>Rufus Black’s lips curled as he looked on these luxuries
and mentally calculated their cost. He was in the midst
of his calculation when the door of the adjoining bedroom
was opened from within, and his father came out,
habited in slippers and dressing-gown, and with an Indian
embroidered cap of scarlet and gold poised lightly on his
fair head.</p>

<p>His light eyes opened a little wider than usual as he
beheld his son, and his usual cynical smile showed itself
disagreeably around his white teeth.</p>

<p>“So you’ve come at last, have you?” he exclaimed.
“I expected you yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I received your letter this morning, soon after breakfast,
sir,” answered Rufus, “and I came on at once in the
express train. I have changed my lodgings from the one
you knew, and the letter was sent on from my old to my
new address.”</p>

<p>Mr. Black eyed his son critically, his cynical smile
deepening.</p>

<p>“You have a general out-at-the-elbows look,” he observed.
“You’ve gone down hill since I threw you over.
You look hungry and desperate!”</p>

<p>“I am both,” was the reply, in a reckless tone. “And
I have reason to be. I am starving!”</p>

<p>Mr. Black flung himself into the only easy chair the
room afforded, and made a gesture to his son to be seated
upon the couch. Rufus obeyed.</p>

<p>“You are in the mood I hoped to find you,” declared<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
the father, with a disagreeable laugh. “Desperate&mdash;starving!
That is better than I expected. What has
become of all your fine anticipations of wealth and fortune
achieved with your brush? You do not find it easy
to paint famous pictures?”</p>

<p>“I mistook my desires for ability,” cried Rufus, his
eyes darkening with the pain of his confession. “I have
a liking for painting, and I fancied that liking was genius.
I find myself crippled by not knowing how to do anything
well. My pictures bring me in fifteen shillings
apiece, and cost me three days’ work. I could earn more
at brick-making&mdash;if I only knew how to make bricks.
When you sent me to the university, father, you said I
should study a profession. I demand of you the fulfilment
of that promise. I want some way to earn my
living!”</p>

<p>“Better get a living without work,” said Mr. Black
coolly. “I don’t like work, and I don’t believe you do.
You want to study law, but your talents are not transcendent,
my son&mdash;you will never sit upon the woolsack.”</p>

<p>“If I can earn two hundred pounds a year, I will ask
nothing more,” said Rufus bitterly. “I have discovered
for myself that my abilities are mediocre. I shall never
be great as anything&mdash;unless as a failure! But if I can
only glide along in the great stream of mediocre people,
and be nothing above or below them, I shall be content!”</p>

<p>“And you say this at twenty years old?” cried his
father mockingly. “You talk like one of double your
years. Where have your hopefulness, your bright dreams,
your glowing anticipations, gone? You must have had
a hard experience in the last three months, to be willing
to settle down into a hard-working drudge!”</p>

<p>“My experience <em>has</em> been hard.”</p>

<p>“I believe you. You look beaten out, worn out, discouraged.<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
Now, Rufus, I have sent for you that I may
make your fortune as well as mine. There is a grand
prospect opening before you, and you can be one of the
richest men in England, if you choose to be sensible.
But you must obey my orders.”</p>

<p>“I cannot promise that before knowing what you
demand,” said the son, his face clouding. “I have no
sympathy with your manner of life, father. If you had
not the advantage of titled connections, and did not
bear the title of ‘Honorable,’ you would be called an
adventurer. You know you would. I want nothing to
do with your ways of life. I will not be a gambler&mdash;not
for all the wealth in England!”</p>

<p>“Don’t refuse till you are asked,” said Mr. Black
harshly. “Don’t imagine that I want to corrupt your
fine principles by making a gambler of you. I am no
gamester, even though I play at cards. I play only as
gentlemen play. The game I have in hand for you is
easily played, if you have but ordinary skill. I can
make you master of one of the finest estates in England,
if you but say the word!”</p>

<p>“Honorably? Can you do it honorably?” cried Rufus
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I would not propose anything dishonorable
to one of your nice sense of honor,” said Mr. Black,
with sarcastic emphasis.</p>

<p>“What is it you would have me do?”</p>

<p>“You are young, enthusiastic, well looking and well
educated,” said Mr. Black, without paying heed to his
son’s questions. “In short, you are fitted to the business
I have in hand. I intended to give you a professional
education, but if you obey me you won’t want it, and if
you do not obey me you may go to the dogs. I suppose
your poverty has driven that little low-born music
teacher out of your head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>“What has she to do with this business?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever. I want to make sure that you
are well rid of her, but perhaps it would be as well to
leave her name out of the question. You say you are
starving. Now, if you will solemnly promise to obey
me, I will advance you fifty pounds to-day, with which
you can fit up your wardrobe and gratify any luxurious
desires you may have.”</p>

<p>Rufus Black’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Speak,” he said impatiently. “I am desperately
poor. I would do almost anything for fifty pounds.
What do you want done?”</p>

<p>Again Craven Black laughed softly, well pleased with
his son’s mood.</p>

<p>“Did you see Hawkhurst as you came?” he asked, with
seeming irrelevancy. “It’s one of the grandest places in
Kent.”</p>

<p>“I saw it. The driver pointed it out to me.”</p>

<p>“How did it look to you?”</p>

<p>“Like heaven.”</p>

<p>“How would you like to be master of that heaven?”</p>

<p>Rufus stared at his father with wide, incredulous
eyes.</p>

<p>“You are chaffing me,” said the young man, his countenance
falling.</p>

<p>“I am in serious earnest. The owner of Hawkhurst
is a young girl, who is expected home from school to-day.
She has lived the life of a nun in her French school, and
does not know one young man from another. She will
be beset with suitors immediately, and the one who
comes first stands the best chance of winning her. I
want you to make love to her and marry her.”</p>

<p>Rufus Black’s face paled. The suggestion nearly
overcame him. The project looked stupendous, chimerical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“I wondered that you should be down here at Wyndham,
father,” he said, “and I suppose you are here because
you had formed some design upon this young
heiress. Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“No, but I know her step-mother, who is her personal
guardian,” explained Craven Black. “Do you remember
the handsome widow, Mrs. Hathaway, whom you
saw once at the theatre in my charge? She married Sir
Harold Wynde. He died in India last year, leaving her
well-jointured. I came down to see her the other day,
and it seems she remembers me with her old affection.
In short, Rufus, I am engaged to marry Lady Wynde,
and the wedding is to take place in October. She is her
step-daughter’s guardian, as I said, and will have unbounded
influence to back up your suit. The field is clear
before you. Go in and win!”</p>

<p>Rufus grew yet paler, and his voice was hoarse as he
asked:</p>

<p>“And this is your scheme for making me rich?”</p>

<p>“It is. The girl has a clear income of seventy thousand
pounds a year. As her husband, you will be a man
of consequence. She owns a house in town, a hunting
box in the Scottish Highlands, and other houses in England.
You will have horses and hounds; a yacht, if
you wish it, at your marine villa, and a bottomless purse.
You can paint wretched pictures, and hear the fashionable
world praise them as divine. You can become a
member of Parliament. All careers are open to the fortunate
suitor of Neva Wynde.”</p>

<p>The picture was dazzling enough to the half-starved
and desperate boy. He liked all these things his father
enumerated&mdash;the houses, the horses, the luxuries, the
money, and the luxurious ease and the honors. He had
found it hard to work, and harder to dispose of his
work. All the bitterness and hardness of his lot arose<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
before him in black contrast with the brightness and
beauty that would mark the destiny of the favored lover
of young Neva Wynde.</p>

<p>He arose and walked the floor with an impetuous
tread, an expression of keen anguish and keener longing
in his eyes. His father watched him with a furtive
gaze, as a cat watches a mouse. It was necessary to his
plans that his son should marry Neva Wynde, and he
was sanguine that he would be able to bring about the
match.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, tiring of the quick, impetuous walk
of his son. “What do you say?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible!” returned Rufus abruptly. “Utterly
impossible.”</p>

<p>“And why, if I may be allowed to ask?” inquired Mr.
Black blandly, although a scowl began to gather on his
fair forehead.</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;because&mdash;the young lady may have other
designs for herself&mdash;I can’t marry her for her money&mdash;I
can’t give up Lally!”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;the young person who taught music? I understood
you to say that she was a corn-chandler’s daughter.
And you prefer a low-born, low-bred creature to a
wealthy young lady like Miss Wynde? For a young
man educated as you have been, your good taste is remarkable.
You have a predilection for high-class society,
I must say. What is the charm of this not-to-be-given-up
‘Lally?’ Is she beautiful?”</p>

<p>“She is beautiful to me.”</p>

<p>“Which means that she is beautiful to no one else.
The beauty which requires love’s spectacles to distinguish,
is ugliness to every one but the lover. Low-born
and low-bred,” repeated Mr. Black, dwelling upon the
words as if they pleased him, “with a pack of poor and
ignorant relations tacked to her skirts, ugly by your<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
own confession, what a brilliant match she would be for
the son of the Honorable Craven Black!”</p>

<p>“She has no poor relations,” said Rufus hotly. “She
has no relations except a great-aunt, whose name she
does not know, and who very likely does not dream of
her existence. It is true that Lally’s father was a corn-chandler,
but he was an honest one, and more than that,
he was an intelligent, upright gentlemen. You arch
your brows, as if a man could not be a tradesman and a
gentleman. If the word gentleman has any meaning, he
was a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I do not care to discuss the subtle meaning of words;
I am willing to accept them at the valuation society
puts upon them. The pedigree of ‘Lally’ is of no interest
to me. I merely want to know if you mean to marry
Neva Wynde and be rich, or marry your ‘Lally’ and
starve. And if you are willing to starve yourself, are
you willing to have ‘Lally’ starve also? With your fine
ideas of honor, I wonder you can wish to drag that girl
into a marriage that will be to her but a slow death.”</p>

<p>A groan burst from the youth’s lips. He wrung his
hands weakly, while the secret of his marriage trembled
on his tongue. But he dared not tell it. He was afraid
of his father with a deadly fear, and more than that, he
had yet some hope of receiving assistance from his
parent.</p>

<p>“I cannot give her up, father,” he said hoarsely. “I
beg you to help me in some way, and let me go. You
are not rich, I know, but you have influence. You could
get me a situation under government, in the Home office,
Somerset House, or as secretary to some nobleman. If
you will do this for me, I will bless you while I live.
Oh, father, be merciful to me. Give me a little help,
and let me go my ways.”</p>

<p>“By Heaven, I will not. If you cling to that girl, you<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
shall have not one penny from me, not one word of recommendation.
You can drift to the hospital, or the
alms-house, and I will not raise a finger to help you! I
will not even give one farthing to save you from a pauper’s
burial. I swear it!”</p>

<p>Craven Black uttered the oath in a tone of utter implacability,
and Rufus knew that the heavens would sooner
fall than his father would relent. A despair seized upon
him, and again he wrung his hands, as he cried out recklessly:</p>

<p>“I <em>must</em> cling to her, father. Cast me off if you will,
curse me as you choose&mdash;but Lally is my wife!”</p>

<p>Craven Black was stupefied for the moment. An apoplectic
redness suffused his face, and his eyes gleamed
dangerously.</p>

<p>“Your wife? Your wife?” he muttered, scarcely knowing
that he spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is my wife,” declared Rufus, his voice gathering
firmness. “I married her three months ago. We
have been starving together in a garret at New Brompton.
Oh, father&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not one word! Married to that girl? I will not
believe it. Have you a marriage certificate?”</p>

<p>“I have. Here it is,” and Rufus drew from his
pocket-book a slender folded paper. “Read it, and you
will see that I tell the truth. Lally Bird is my wife!”</p>

<p>Craven Black took the paper and perused it with
strange deliberation, the apoplectic redness still suffusing
his face. When he had finished, he deliberately tore
the marriage certificate into shreds. Rufus uttered a
cry, and sprang forward to seize the precious document,
but his father waved him back with a gesture of stern
command.</p>

<p>“Poor fool!” said the elder man. “The destruction<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
of this paper would not affect the validity of your marriage,
if it were valid. But it is not valid.”</p>

<p>“Not valid.”</p>

<p>“No; you and the girl are both minors. A marriage
of minors without consent of parents and guardians is
not binding. The girl is not your wife!”</p>

<p>“But she is my wife. We were married in church&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That won’t make the marriage binding. You are a
minor, and so is she. She had no one to consult, but
you married without my consent, and that fact will render
the marriage null and void. More than this,” and
Mr. Black’s eyes sparkled wickedly, “you have committed
perjury. You obtained your marriage license by declaring
yourself of age, and you will not become of age
under some months. Do you know what the punishment
is for perjury. It is imprisonment, disgrace, a
striped suit, and prison fare.”</p>

<p>The young man looked appalled.</p>

<p>“Who would prosecute me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> would. You have got yourself in a tight box, young
man. Your marriage is null and void, and you have
committed perjury. Now I will offer you your choice
between two alternatives. You can make love to Miss
Wynde and marry her, and be somebody. Or, if you refuse,
I will prosecute you for perjury, will have you sent
to prison, and will brand that girl with a name that will
fix her social station for life. Take your choice.”</p>

<p>Craven Black meant every word he said, and Rufus
knew that he meant it. The young fellow shuddered and
trembled, and then broke into a wild appeal for mercy,
but his father turned a deaf ear to his anguished
cry.</p>

<p>“You have my decision,” he said coldly. “I shall not
reconsider it. The girl is not your wife, and when she
knows her position she will fly from you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>Rufus groaned in his anguish. He knew well the pure
soul of his young wife, and he felt that she would not remain
in any position that was equivocal, even though to
leave him might break her heart. The disgrace, the terror,
the poverty of his lot, nearly crushed him to the
earth.</p>

<p>“What is your answer to be?” demanded Mr.
Black.</p>

<p>The poor young fellow sat down and covered his face
with his hands. He was terribly frightened, and the inherent
weakness and cowardice of his character, otherwise
full of noble traits, proved fatal to him now. He
gasped out:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know. I must have time to think. It is all
so strange&mdash;so terrible.”</p>

<p>“You can have all day in which to consider the matter.
I have engaged a bedroom for you on the opposite side
of the hall. I will show you to it, and you can think the
matter over in solitude.”</p>

<p>Mr. Black arose and conducted his son across the hall
to a bedroom overlooking the street and the four corners,
and here, with a last repetition of the two alternatives
offered him, he left him.</p>

<p>Poor Rufus, weak and despairing, locked the door and
dropped upon his knees, sobbing aloud in the extremity
of his anguish.</p>

<p>“What shall I do? What can I do?” he moaned. “She
is not my wife. My poor Lally! And I am helpless in
my father’s hands. I shall have to yield&mdash;I feel it&mdash;I
know it. I wish I were dead. Oh, my poor wronged
Lally!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA AT HOME AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The home coming of the heiress of Hawkhurst was far
different from that which her father had once lovingly
planned for her when looking forward to her emancipation
from school. There was no sign of festivity about
the estate, no gathering of tenants to a feast, no dancing
on the lawn, no floral arches, no music, no gladness of
welcome. The carriage containing Neva Wynde and
Mrs. Artress, and attended by liveried servants, turned
quietly into the lodge gates, halted a moment while Neva
spoke to the lodge keepers, whom she well remembered,
and then slowly ascended the long shaded drive toward
the house.</p>

<p>Neva looked around her with kindling eyes. The fair
green lawn with its patches of sunshine and shade, the
close lying park with the shy deer browsing near the invisible
wire fence that separated the park from the lawn,
the odors of the flower gardens, all these were inexpressibly
sweet to her after her years of absence from her
home.</p>

<p>“Home again!” she murmured softly. “Although those
who made it the dearest spot in all the world to me are
gone, yet still it is home. No place has charms for me
like this.”</p>

<p>The carriage swept up under the high-pointed arch of
the lime trees, and drew up in the porch, where the
ladies alighted. Artress led the way into the house, and
Neva followed with a springing step and a wildly beating
heart.</p>

<p>The great baronial hall was not brightened with<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
flowers or green boughs. The oaken floor, black as
ebony, was polished like jet. The black, wainscoted
walls, hung with ancient pictures, glittering shields, a
few fowling pieces, a stag’s head with antlers, an ancient
boar’s head, and other treasures, was wide, cool and
hospitable. No servants were gathered here, although
Neva looked for them and was disappointed in not seeing
them. Most of the servants had been at Hawkhurst
for many years, and Neva regarded them as old friends.</p>

<p>It had been the wish of the butler and housekeeper to
marshal their subordinates in the great hall to welcome
their young mistress, but Lady Wynde, hearing of their
design, had peremptorily forbidden it, with the remark
that until she came of age, Miss Wynde would not be
mistress of Hawkhurst. And therefore no alternative
had remained for the butler and housekeeper but to
smother their indignation and submit to Lady Wynde’s
decree.</p>

<p>Mrs. Artress flung open the door of the drawing-room
with an excessive politeness and said:</p>

<p>“Be kind enough to enter, Miss Wynde, and make
yourself comfortable while I inform Lady Wynde of
your arrival.”</p>

<p>“I am not a guest in my own home, and I decline to
be treated as one,” said Neva quietly. “I presume
my rooms are ready, and I will go up to them immediately.”</p>

<p>“I am not positive,” said Artress hesitatingly, “as to
the rooms Lady Wynde has ordered to be made ready
for your use. I will ring and see.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I won’t put you to the trouble. I shall
resume possession of my old rooms, whatever rooms
may have been made ready,” said Neva half haughtily.</p>

<p>Her cheeks burned with a sense of indignation and
annoyance at the strangeness of her reception. She<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
had not wished for the rejoicings her father had once
planned for her, but she had entered her own house precisely
as some hireling might have done, with no one to
receive or greet her, no one to care if she had come.
She turned away to ascend the stairs, but paused with
her foot on the lowest step as a door at the further
end of the hall opened, and the housekeeper, rosy and rotund,
with cap ribbons flying, came rushing forward with
outstretched arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Miss Neva,” cried the good woman,
who had known and loved the baronet’s daughter from
her birth. “Welcome home, my sweet lamb! How
you have grown&mdash;so tall, so beautiful, so bright and
sweet!”</p>

<p>“You dear old Hopper!” exclaimed Neva, springing
forward and embracing the good woman with girlish
fervor. “I began to think I must have entered a strange
house. I am so glad to see you!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Artress looked upon this little scene with an air
of disgust, and with a little sniff hastened up the stairs
to the apartments of Lady Wynde.</p>

<p>“Your rooms are ready, Miss Neva,” said Mrs. Hopper&mdash;“your
old rooms. I made sure you wanted them
again, because poor Sir Harold furnished them new for
you only four years ago. I will go with you up stairs.”</p>

<p>Neva led the way, tripping lightly up the broad steps,
and flitting along the wide upper hall.</p>

<p>Her rooms comprised a suit opposite those of Lady
Wynde. Neva opened the door of her sitting-room and
went in. The portly old butler was arranging wreaths
of flowers about the pictures and statuettes, but turned
as the young girl came in, and welcomed her with an
admixture of warmth and respectfulness that were pleasant
to witness. Then he took his basket of cuttings and
withdrew, the tears of joy flooding his honest eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>The girl’s sitting-room had been transformed by the
loving forethought of the butler into a very bower of
beauty. The carpet was of a pale azure hue starred
with arbutus blossoms, and the furniture was upholstered
in blue silk of the same delicate tint. The pictures on
the walls were all choice and framed in gilt, and with
their wreaths of odorous blossoms, gave a fairy brightness
to the room. The silvermounted grate was crowded
thickly with choice flowers from the conservatory, whose
colors of white and blue were here and there relieved
with scarlet blossoms like living coals. The wide French
windows, opening upon a balcony, were open.</p>

<p>“Ah, this is home!” said Neva, sinking down upon a
silken couch, and looking out of one of the windows
upon the lawn. “I am glad to be back again, Hopper,
but it’s a sad home coming. Poor Papa!”</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Harold!” echoed the housekeeper, wiping
her eyes. “If he could only have lived to see you grown
up, Miss Neva. It was dreadful that he should have
been taken as he was. I can’t somehow get over the
shock of his death.”</p>

<p>“I shall never get over it!” murmured Neva softly.</p>

<p>“I am making you cry the first thing after your return,”
exclaimed Mrs. Hopper, in self-reproach. “I hope
those tears are not a bad omen for you, Miss Neva. I
have arranged your rooms,” she added, “as they used to
be, and if they are not right you have only to say so.
You are mistress of Hawkhurst now. Did you bring a
maid from Paris, Miss Neva?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Artress said it was not necessary, and my
maid at school did not wish to leave France. Mrs. Artress
said that Lady Wynde had engaged a maid for
me.”</p>

<p>“Her ladyship intended to give you her own maid,
but I made bold to engage your old attendant, Meggy<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
West, and she is in your bedroom now. She is wild
with joy at the prospect of serving you again.”</p>

<p>Neva remembered the girl Meggy with pleasure, and
said so.</p>

<p>“I had dreaded having a strange attendant,” she said.
“You were very thoughtful, Hopper. I suppose I ought
to dress at once. Since Lady Wynde did not meet me
at the door, she evidently means to be ceremonious, and
I must conform to her wishes. I am impatient to see
my step-mother, Hopper. Is she as good as she is handsome?”</p>

<p>“I am not fond of Lady Wynde, Miss Neva,” replied
the housekeeper, coloring. “Her ways are different from
any I have been accustomed to, but you must judge of
her for yourself. Sir Harold just worshiped the ground
she walked on.”</p>

<p>Neva did not pursue her questioning, comprehending
that Lady Wynde was not adored by the housekeeper,
whoever else might admire her. The young girl was
not one to gossip with servants, nor even with Mrs.
Hopper, who was lady by birth and education, and she
dropped the subject. Soon after Mrs. Hopper withdrew,
and Neva went into her bedroom.</p>

<p>She found here the maid who had attended her before
she had left home, and who was now to resume service
with her. The girl was about her own age, bright-eyed
and red-cheeked, hearty and wholesome, the daughter
of one of the Hawkhurst tenants. Neva greeted her so
kindly as to revive the girl’s old affection for her with
added fervor, and, Neva’s trunks having arrived, the
process of the toilet was at once entered upon.</p>

<p>The dress of the heiress of Hawkhurst was exceedingly
simple, but she looked very lovely when fully attired.
She wore a dress and overskirt of white Swiss
muslin, trimmed with puffs and ruffles. A broad black<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
sash was tied around her waist, with a big bow and ends
at the back. Ear-rings, bracelets, and brooch of jet,
were her ornaments.</p>

<p>The housekeeper sent up a tempting lunch, and after
partaking of it Neva went down stairs to the great drawing-room,
but it was untenanted. She stood in the large
circular window and looked out upon the cool depths of
the park, and became absorbed in thought. More than
half an hour thus passed, and Neva was beginning to
wonder that no one came to her, when the rustling of
silk outside the door was heard, and Lady Wynde came
sweeping into the room.</p>

<p>Her ladyship presented a decidedly striking appearance.
She had laid aside the last vestige of her mourning
garments, and wore a long maize-colored robe of
heavy silk, with ornaments of rubies. Her brunette
beauty was admirably enhanced by her attire, and Neva
thought she had never seen a woman more handsome or
more imposing.</p>

<p>Behind Lady Wynde came Artress, clad in soft gray
garb, as usual, and making an excellent foil to her employer.</p>

<p>“Lady Wynde, this is Miss Wynde,” said the gray
companion, in her soft, cloying voice.</p>

<p>Neva came forward, frank and sweet, offering her
hand to her step-mother. Lady Wynde touched it with
two fingers, and stooping, kissed the girl’s forehead.</p>

<p>“You are welcome home, Neva,” she said graciously.
“I am glad to see you, my dear. I began to think we
should never meet. Why, how tall you are&mdash;not at all
the little girl I expected to see.”</p>

<p>“I am eighteen, you may remember, Lady Wynde,”
returned Neva quietly. “One is not usually very small
at that age.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship surveyed her step-daughter with keen<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
scrutiny. She had already heard Artress’ account of the
voyage home from Calais, and of Neva’s meeting with
Lord Towyn, and she was anxious to form some idea of
the girl’s character.</p>

<p>She saw in the first moment that here was not the insipid,
“bread-and-butter school girl” she had expected.
The frank, lovely face, so bright and piquant, was full of
character, and the red-brown eyes bravely uplifted betrayed
a soul awake and resolute. Neva’s glances were
as keen as her own, and Lady Wynde had an uncomfortable
impression that her step-daughter was reading her
true character.</p>

<p>“Sit down, my dear,” she said, somewhat disconcerted.
“Artress has been telling me about your voyage. Artress
is my friend and companion, as I wrote you, and
has lived with me so many years that I have learned to
regard her as a sister. I hope you will be friends with
her. She is an excellent mentor to thoughtless youth.”</p>

<p>Neva bowed, but the smile that played for an instant
on her saucy lips was not encouraging to the would-be
“mentor.”</p>

<p>“I shall try not to trouble her,” she said, smiling,
“although I shall always be glad to receive advice from
my father’s wife. I trust that you and I will be friends,
Lady Wynde, for poor papa’s sake.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde sat down beside her step-daughter.
Artress retreated to a recessed window, and took up her
usual embroidery. Neva exerted herself to converse
with her step-mother, and was soon conscious of a feeling
of disappointment in her. She felt that Lady
Wynde was insincere, a hypocrite, and a double-dealer,
and she experienced a sense of uneasiness in her presence.
Could this be the wife her father had adored?
she asked herself. And then she accused herself of injustice
and harsh judgment, believing that her father<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
could not have been so mistaken in the character of his
wife, and in atonement for her unfavorable opinion she
was very gentle, and full of deference. Lady Wynde
congratulated herself upon having won her step-daughter’s
good opinion after all.</p>

<p>“I must acquire a thorough control and unbounded
influence over her,” she thought. “But how can I do
it? If her father had only left her stronger injunctions
to sacrifice everything to my wishes, I think she would
obey the injunctions as if a voice spoke to her from the
grave. She will obey in all things reasonable&mdash;I can
see that. But if she has formed a liking for Lord
Towyn, how am I to compel her to marry Rufus
Black?”</p>

<p>The question occupied her attention even while she
talked with Neva. It made her thoughtful through the
dinner hour, and silent afterward. Neva was tired, and
went to her own rooms for the night soon after dinner,
and Lady Wynde and Artress talked together for a
long time in low tones.</p>

<p>“I have it!” said her ladyship exultantly, at last. “I
have a brilliant idea, Artress, that will make this girl my
bond-slave. But I shall need the cooperation of Craven.
I must see him this very evening. It is strange he does
not come&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is here,” said the gray companion, as the house
door clanged and heavily shut. “I will go to my room.”</p>

<p>She slipped like a shadow down the long triple drawing-room
and out at one door, as the Honorable Craven
Black was ushered in at the other. Lady Wynde rose
to receive him, welcoming him with smiles, and presently
she unfolded to him the scheme she had just conceived,
and the two conspirators proceeded to discuss
it and amplify it, and prepare it for the ensnarement of
the baronet’s daughter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LADY WYNDE’S IDEA ACTED UPON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was still early upon the evening of Neva’s return
to Hawkhurst when Craven Black took his leave of the
handsome widow and set out upon his walk to Wyndham.
The summer night was filled with a light, pleasant
gloom; and the songs of the nightingales, the chirping
and drumming of insects in the Hawkhurst park
and plantations, made the air musical. But Craven
Black gave no heed to these things as he strode along
over the hilly road. His mind was busy with the
scheme that had been suggested to him that evening by
Lady Wynde, and as he hurried along, he muttered:</p>

<p>“It’s a good idea, if well worked out. But there’s no
finesse in it. It’s too simple, if it has any fault. And
the girl may see through it, although that’s not likely.
People who are guileless themselves are not apt to suspect
guile in others. We shall have no difficulty with
her. The only one who can balk our plans is that obstinate
boy of mine, whom I have not seen since he shut
himself up in his chamber. I must know his decision
before I move a step further in this business. Of course
he will yield to me; he has never dared pit his will
against mine, and say to my face that he would not
obey me. Poor weak coward! If he dares cling to
that girl he married, I’ll risk the exposure and disgrace,
and have the marriage legally set aside on the ground
of his minority. By Heaven, if he dares to beard me,
he shall find me a very tiger!”</p>

<p>He set his teeth together and his breath came hissingly
between them as he strode heavily along the village<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
street and approached the Wyndham inn. He saw
that his own rooms were lighted, and that the room
that he had assigned his son was dark. The fear came
to him that Rufus had stolen away and returned to his
young wife with the mad idea of flying with her, and,
with a muttered curse upon the boy, he hurried into the
inn and sped swiftly up the stairs, halting at his son’s
door, with his hand on the knob.</p>

<p>It did not yield to his touch. The door was locked
from within. Rufus must be within that darkened
chamber, and as this conviction came to him Craven
Black recovered all his coolness and self-possession. He
crossed the hall into his own room and procured a
lighted lamp, and then returned and knocked loudly on
his son’s door. No voice answered him. No sound
came from within the room.</p>

<p>“Can he have committed suicide?” Craven Black
asked himself, with a sudden fluttering at his heart.
“He was desperate enough, but I hardly think he could
have been such a fool as that.”</p>

<p>He shook the door loudly, but eliciting no reply, he
stooped to the key-hole, and cried, in a clear, hissing
whisper:</p>

<p>“Rufus, open this door, or I’ll break it in! I’ll arouse
the whole house. Quick, I say! Be lively!”</p>

<p>There was a faint stir within the room, as if a tortured
wild beast were sluggishly turning in his cage,
and then an unsteady step crossed the floor, and an
unsteady hand groped feebly about the door, seeking
the key. The bolt suddenly shot back, and then the
unsteady steps retreated a few paces.</p>

<p>Craven Black opened the door and entered the room,
closing the portal behind him. He set down his lamp,
and his light eyes then sought out the form of his son.</p>

<p>Rufus stood in the centre of the room, his eyes<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
covered with one hand to shade them from the sudden
light, his figure drooping and abject, his head bowed to
his breast, his mouth white and drawn with lines of pain.
It seemed as if years had passed over his head since the
morning. It would have been scarcely possible to trace
in this spiritless, slouching figure, in this white, haggard
face, the boy artist who had left his young wife that
morning. All the brightness, elasticity and youth
seemed gone from him, leaving only a poor broken
wreck.</p>

<p>The cynical smile that was so characteristic of Craven
Black’s countenance came back to his lips as he looked
upon his son. He read in the changed aspect of the
boy that he had achieved a victory over Rufus.</p>

<p>“I have come for your decision, Rufus,” he said.
“What is it to be? Disgrace, imprisonment, a blasted
name? Or will you turn from your low-born adventuress
and accept the career I have marked out for you?
Speak!”</p>

<p>The hand that shaded the artist’s eyes dropped, and
he looked at his father with a countenance so wan, so
woeful, so despairing, that a very demon might have
pitied him. Yet his father only smiled at what he
deemed the evidence of the lad’s weakness.</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” said the young man hollowly, “will you
not have mercy upon me&mdash;upon <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p>“None!” replied Craven Black curtly. “Again I
demand your choice!”</p>

<p>Rufus wrung his hands in wild despair.</p>

<p>“If I abandon her, what will become of her?” he
moaned. “She will die of starvation! My poor little
wife!”</p>

<p>“Do not call her again by that title!” cried Craven
Black frowning. “Can you not comprehend that the
marriage is illegal&mdash;is null and void&mdash;that she is not your<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
wife? When she hears the truth, she will turn from you
in loathing. As to her support, I will provide for her.
She shall not starve, as she will do if you are sent to
prison for perjury. For the last time I demand your
decision. Will you give up the girl peaceably, or will
you be forced to?”</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence. Then the
answer came brokenly from the young man’s lips.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I give her up!” he muttered. “God help us
both!”</p>

<p>“It is well,” declared Craven Black, more kindly.
“You could not do otherwise. You like the girl now,
but a year hence you will smile at your present folly.
Why should you fling away all your possibilities of
wealth and honor for a silly boyish fancy? Cheer up,
Rufus. Throw aside all that despair, and accept the
goods the gods provide you. The girl will marry some
one else, as you must do. Your future bride has arrived
at Hawkhurst, and to-morrow evening I shall take you
to call upon her. I suppose you have eaten nothing since
the morning, and your first need is supper.”</p>

<p>He rang the bell vigorously, and to the servant who
came up gave an order for supper&mdash;to be served in his
own parlor. Taking up his lamp, and drawing his son’s
arm through his, he conducted Rufus to his own rooms,
and seated him in an easy-chair. The young man’s
head fell forward on his breast and he sat in silence,
but Craven Black, rendered good-natured by the success
of his schemes, talked at considerable length of the revenues
of Hawkhurst, and the perfections of Lady Wynde,
and of Neva, whom he had not yet seen.</p>

<p>The supper of cold game was brought up, and Mr.
Black ordered two bottles of wine. Rufus refused to
eat, having, as he declared, no appetite, but he drank an
entire bottle of wine with a recklessness he had never<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
before displayed, and was finally prevailed upon to take
food. When he had finished, he arose abruptly and retired
to his own chamber.</p>

<p>The waiter removed the remains of the supper, and
Craven Black was left alone. He sat a little while in his
chair, with a complacent smile on his fair visage, and
then arose and locked his door, and brought forward his
small inlaid writing-desk and deposited it upon the
table.</p>

<p>He produced from his pocket a small packet which
Lady Wynde had given him that evening, and opened
it. It contained a dozen sheets of note paper, of the style
Sir Harold had liked and had habitually used. It was a
heavy cream-colored vellum paper, unlined, and very
thick and smooth. Upon the upper half of the first page
was engraven in black and gold the baronet’s monogram
and crest, and below these to the right, in quaint black
and gold letters, were stamped the words, “Hawkhurst,
Kent.” It was upon paper like this that nearly all of Sir
Harold’s letters to his daughter had been written.</p>

<p>A dozen square envelopes similarly adorned with crest
and monogram accompanied the paper; and a tiny vial
of a peculiar black ink, a half stick of bronze wax, Sir
Harold’s seal, and a half dozen letters, comprised the remaining
contents of the packet.</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn across the windows, and Mr.
Black had carefully vailed the keyhole of his door, so he
leaned back in his chair, with a pleasant feeling of
security, and engaged in the study of the letters.
Five of them had been written by Sir Harold to his wife
during the early part of his visit to India, and bore the
Indian postmark. The sixth letter had been an enclosure
in one of those to Lady Wynde, and was addressed
to Neva. It had evidently been thus inclosed by Sir
Harold under the impression that Neva would spend her<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
midsummer holidays at Hawkhurst in the absence of her
father. The letter had been opened by Lady Wynde
and read, and she had thrown it aside, without thought
of delivering it to its rightful owner.</p>

<p>“How the baronet adored his wife!” thought Craven
Black, as he carefully perused the letters. “What a
depth of passion these letters show. It is strange that
Octavia should not have been touched and pleased by
his devotion, and learned to return it. But she had an
equal passion for me, and thought of him only as an
obstacle to be removed from her path. I never loved a
woman as Sir Harold loved her. I do not think I am
capable of such intense devotion. I am fond of Octavia&mdash;more
fond of her than I ever was of woman before.
She is handsome, stately and keen-witted. Her tastes
and mine are similar. She will make me a rich man,
and consequently a happy one. Four thousand a year
from her, and ten thousand a year from Rufus when he
marries Miss Wynde. That won’t be bad. I could have
married an African with prospects such as these!”</p>

<p>He studied the style of the composition, the peculiar
expression, and the penmanship, at great length, and
then took up Sir Harold’s intercepted letter to his
daughter. It was very tender and loving, and was written
in a deep gloom after the death of the baronet’s son
in India. It declared that the father felt a strange conviction
that he should never see again his home, his wife,
or his daughter, and he conjured Neva by her love for
him to be gentle, loving and obedient to her step-mother,
to soothe Lady Wynde in the anguish his death
would cause her, if his forebodings proved true, and he
should die in India.</p>

<p>“Women are mostly fools!” muttered Craven Black
impatiently. “Why didn’t Octavia send the girl this
letter? Probably because Sir Harold mentions in it her<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
probable anguish at his loss, and she was waiting impatiently
for the hour of her <a id="Ref_114" href="#BRef_114">third</a> marriage. And Sir
Harold writes as if he had expected his daughter to
spend her summer’s holidays at Hawkhurst, and Octavia
did not want her here at that time. The girl must have
the letter. It will strengthen Octavia’s influence over
her immensely.”</p>

<p>After an hour’s keen study, Craven Black seized pen
and ink and carefully imitated upon scraps of paper the
peculiar and characteristic handwriting of Sir Harold.
He had a singular aptitude for this sort of forgery, and
devoted himself to his task with genuine zeal. He
wrote out a letter with careful deliberation, studying the
effect of every line, incorporating some of the favorite
expressions of the baronet, and this he proceeded to copy
upon a sheet of the paper Lady Wynde had given him,
and in a curiously exact imitation of Sir Harold’s penmanship.</p>

<p>He worked for hours upon the letter, finishing it
to his satisfaction only at daybreak of the following
morning. His nefarious composition purported to be a
last letter from Sir Harold Wynde to his daughter, written
the night before his tragic death in India, and under
a terrible gloom and foreboding of approaching death!</p>

<p>The forger began the letter with a declaration of the
most tender, paternal love for Neva on the part of the
father in whose name he wrote, and declared that he
believed himself standing upon the brink of eternity,
and therefore wrote a few last lines to Neva, which he
desired her to receive as an addenda to his last will and
testament.</p>

<p>The letter went on to state that Sir Harold adored his
beautiful wife, but that as she was still young, it was
not his wish that she should spend the remainder of her
life in mourning for him. He desired her to marry<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
again, to form new ties, to take a fresh lease of life, and
to make another as happy as she had made him happy!</p>

<p>This message he wished to be delivered to Lady
Wynde from his daughter’s lips, as his last message to
the wife he had worshiped.</p>

<p>And now came in the subtle point of the forged missive.
As from the pen and heart of Sir Harold Wynde,
the letter went on to say that the father was full of
anxieties in regard to his daughter’s future. She was
young, an heiress, and would perhaps become a prey to
a fortune-hunter. From this fate he desired with all his
soul to save her.</p>

<p>“I think I should rise in my grave, if my loving,
tender little Neva were to marry a man who sought her
for her wealth,” the forged letter said. “If I die here,
I have a last request to make of you, my child, and I
know that your father’s last wish will be held sacred by
you. If I do not die, this letter will never be delivered
to you. I shall send it to the care of Octavia, to be
given to you in the case of my death. I know not why
this strange gloom has come upon me, but I have a premonition
that my death is near. I shall not see you
again in life, my child, my poor little Neva, but if you
obey my last request I shall know it in heaven.</p>

<p>“My request is this. I have long taken a keen interest
in the character and career of a young man now at
Oxford. His talents are good, his character noble and
elevated, his principles excellent. His name is Rufus
Black. He comes of a fine old family, but he is not
rich. There is not a man in the world to whom I would
give you so readily as to Rufus Black. He will come to
see you at Hawkhurst some day when the edge of your
grief for me has worn away, and for my sake treat him
kindly. If he asks you to marry him, consent. I shall
rest easier in my grave if you are his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“My child, your father’s voice speaks to you from the
grave; your father’s arm is stretched out to protect you
in your desolation and helplessness. I lay upon you no
commands, but I pray you, by your love for me, to
marry Rufus Black if he comes to woo you. And as
you heed this, my last request, so may you be happy.”</p>

<p>There was a further page or two of similar purport, and
then the letter closed with a few last tender words, and
the name of Sir Harold Wynde.</p>

<p>“It will do, I think,” said Craven Black exultantly.
“I might have made it stronger, ordered her to marry
Rufus under penalty of a father’s curse, but that would
not have been like Sir Harold Wynde, and she might have
suspected the letter to be a forgery. As it is, Sir Harold
himself would hardly dare to deny the letter as his own,
should his spirit walk in here. I’ve managed the letter
with the requisite delicacy and caution, and there can be
no doubt of the result. The handwriting is perfect.”</p>

<p>He inclosed the letter, and addressed it to Miss Neva
Wynde, sealing it with the bronze wax, and Sir Harold’s
private seal. Then he inclosed the sealed letter in a
larger envelope, that which had inclosed the baronet’s last
letter to his wife from India. The letter which had come
in this envelope was written upon three pages, and contained
nothing at variance with his forged missive. Upon
the fourth and blank page of Sir Harold’s last letter he
forged a postscript, enjoining Lady Wynde to give the
inclosure&mdash;the forgery&mdash;to Neva, in case of his death in
India, but to keep it one year, until her school-days
were ended, and the first bitterness of grief at her father’s
death was past.</p>

<p>Craven Black made up the double letter into a thick
packet resembling a book, and addressed it to Lady
Wynde. He gathered together all his scraps of paper
and the envelopes remaining and burned them, and<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
cleared away the evidences of his night’s work. He extinguished
his lights, drew back his curtains, opened his
windows to the summer morning breeze, and flung himself
on a sofa and went to sleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened about eight o’clock by the waiter at
the door with his breakfast. He arose yawning, gave
the waiter admittance, and summoned a messenger, whom
he dispatched to Hawkhurst, early as was the hour, with
orders to give the packet he had made into the hands
of Lady Wynde or Mrs. Artress, Lady Wynde’s companion.</p>

<p>“Artress will be on the look-out for him,” thought
Craven Black. “She will meet the messenger at the
lodge gates, and carry the packet herself to Octavia. So
that is arranged!”</p>

<p>He summoned his son to breakfast, and presently
Rufus came in, worn and haggard, having evidently
passed a sleepless night. The two men ate their breakfast
without speaking. After the meal, when the tray
had been removed, Rufus would have withdrawn, but his
father commanded him to remain.</p>

<p>“I want you to write a letter to that girl in Brompton,”
said Craven Black, in the tone that always compelled the
abject obedience of his son. “Tell her it is all up between
you&mdash;that she is not your wife&mdash;that you shall never see
her again!”</p>

<p>“I cannot&mdash;I cannot! I must see her again. I must
break the news to her tenderly&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do as I say. There are writing materials on my desk.
Write the letter I have ordered, or, by Heaven, I’ll summon
a constable on the spot!”</p>

<p>Rufus sobbed pitifully, and turned away to hide his
weakness. He was but a boy, a poor, weak, cowardly
boy, afraid of his father, unable to earn a living for himself
and Lally, unable even to support himself, and he<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
had actually gained his marriage license by committing
perjury&mdash;swearing that he was of age, and his own master.
He had laid a snare for himself in that wrong act,
and was now entangled in that snare.</p>

<p>He felt himself helpless in his father’s hands, and sat
down at the desk, and with tear-blinded eyes and unsteady
hand, dashed off a wild, incoherent letter to his
poor young wife, telling her that their marriage was null
and void&mdash;that she was not his wife&mdash;and that they two
must never meet again. When he had appended his
name, he bowed his head on his arms and wept aloud.</p>

<p>Craven Black coolly perused the letter and approved
it. He folded it, and put it in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>“I will take it to her,” he said quietly. “My cab is at
the door, and I am ready to start to London. I shall take
the half-past ten express, if I can reach Canterbury in
time. You will await my return here. I shall be back
before evening. Reconcile yourself to your fate, Rufus,
and don’t look so woe-begone. I shall expect to find you
in a better frame of mind when I return. As to the girl,
I will provide for her liberally. Fortunately I am in funds
just now. I shall send her away somewhere where she will
never cross your path again!”</p>

<p>Without another glance at his son, he took up his hat
and went out. The rumbling of the carriage wheels, as
it bore Craven Black on his way to Canterbury, aroused
Rufus from his stupor. That sound was to him the knell
of his happiness!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BLACK CONTINUES HIS CONSPIRACY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the hours wore on after Rufus Black’s departure
from the dingy little lodging he had called home, poor
Lally became anxious and troubled. Her young husband
had inspired her with a great awe for his father, as well
as terror of him, but she was a brave little soul and prayed
with all her heart that Rufus would have courage to confess
his marriage, let the consequences of that confession
be what they would. She had a horror of concealment
or deception, and she believed that Craven Black would
relent toward his son when he should discover that he
was really married.</p>

<p>As the afternoon of that first day of solitude wore on,
and the hour for Rufus’ return drew near, she swept
and dusted and garnished the dreary little room as well
as she could, put the shining tin kettle on the grate, and
made her simple toilet, putting on her best dress, a cheap
pink lawn that contrasted well with her berry-brown
complexion, and winding a pink ribbon in her hair.
She looked very pretty and fresh and bright when she
had finished, and she stood by the window, her face
pressed to the glass, all hopefulness and expectancy, and
looked out upon the opposite side of the crescent until
long after the hour appointed for her husband’s return.
But when evening came on and the gas lamps were
lighted in the streets, her expectancy was changed to a
terrible anxiety and she put on her shabby little hat
and hurried out to a little newsstand, investing a penny
in an evening paper, with a vague idea that there must<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
have been an accident on the line and that her husband
had perhaps been killed.</p>

<p>But no accident being reported, she returned to her
poor little home, and waited for him with what patience
she could summon. But he came not, and no message,
letter, or telegram came to allay her fears. She waited
for him until midnight, hearkening to every step in the
street, and then lay down without undressing, consoling
herself with the thought that Rufus would be home in
the morning.</p>

<p>But morning came, and Rufus did not come. Poor
Lally was too anxious to prepare her breakfast, and sustained
her strength by eating a piece of bread while she
watched from the window. She assured herself that it
was all right, that Rufus’ prolonged absence was a sign
that he had reconciled himself with his father, and that
probably he would return in company with his parent.
This idea prompted her to brush her tangled waves of
hair, and to press out her tumbled dress and otherwise
make herself presentable.</p>

<p>As the day deepened a conviction that something had
happened that was adverse to her happiness dawned
upon her. It was not like Rufus to leave her in such
suspense, and she was sure that some harm had come to
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has been murdered and thrown out of
the railway coach,” she thought, her round eyes growing
big with horror. “I will go to Wyndham by the next
train.”</p>

<p>She was about to put on her hat when her landlady, a
coarse, ill-bred woman, opened the door unceremoniously,
and entered her presence.</p>

<p>“Going out, Mrs. Black?” she demanded, with a sniff
of suspicion. “I hope you are not going off, like the last
lodger I had in this ’ere blessed room, without paying of<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
the rent? I hope you don’t intend to give me the slip,
Mrs. Black, which you’ve got no clothes nor furniture to
pay the rent, and you owing ten and sixpence!”</p>

<p>“I have the money for the rent, Mrs. McKellar,” answered
Lally, producing her pocket-book, while her
childish face flushed. “I have no intention of giving
you the slip, as you call it. I&mdash;I am going down into
the country to look for my husband. Here is your pay.”</p>

<p>The landlady took her money with an air of relief.
Her greed satisfied, her curiosity became ascendant.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Black, if I may be so bold?” she inquired.
“It’s not like him to be away over night. But
young men will be young men, Mrs. Black, whether they
are young gentlemen or otherwise, and they will have
their sprees, you know, Mrs. Black, although I <em>would</em> say
that Mr. Black seemed as steady a young gentlemen as
one could wish to see.”</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> steady,” asserted the young wife, half indignantly.
“He never goes on a spree. He&mdash;he went to
see his father, and said he would be back last night.
And, oh, I am so anxious!” she cried, her terrors getting
the better of her reserve. “I am sure he would never
have stayed away like this if something had not happened
to him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s deserted you?” suggested her Job’s
comforter. “Men desert their wives every day. Lawks!
What is that?” the landlady ejaculated, as a loud double
knock was heard on the street door. “It’s not the postman.
Perhaps Mr. Black has been killed, and they’re
bringing home his body.”</p>

<p>The poor young wife uttered a wild shriek and flew to
the head of the stairs, the ponderous landlady hurrying
after her, and reaching her side just as the slipshod
maid-servant opened the door, giving admittance to
Craven Black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>The landlady descended the stairs noisily, and Lally
retreated to her room. She had hardly gained it when
Mr. Black came up the stairs alone and knocked at the
door. She gave him admittance, her big round eyes full
of questioning terror, her pale lips framing the words:</p>

<p>“My husband?”</p>

<p>Mr. Black, holding his hat in his hand, closed the door
behind him. He bowed politely to the scared young
creature, and demanded:</p>

<p>“You are Miss Lally Bird?”</p>

<p>The slight, childish figure drew itself up proudly, and
the quivering voice tried to answer calmly:</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am Mrs. Rufus Black. My name used to
be Lally Bird. Do&mdash;do you come from my husband?”</p>

<p>“I come from Mr. Rufus Black,” replied Craven Black
politely. “I am the bearer of a note from him, but
must precede its delivery with an explanation. Mr.
Black is now in Kent, and will remain there for the summer.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t understand you, sir,” said poor Lally,
bewildered.</p>

<p>There was a rustling outside the door, as the landlady
settled herself at the keyhole, in an attitude to listen to
the conversation between Lally and her visitor. Mrs.
McKellar was convinced that there was some mystery
connected with her fourth floor lodgers, and she deemed
this a favorable opportunity of solving it.</p>

<p>“Permit me to introduce myself to you, Miss Bird,”
said her visitor, still courteously. “I am Craven Black,
the father of Rufus.”</p>

<p>The young wife gasped with surprise, and her face
whitened suddenly. She sat down abruptly, with her
hand upon her heart.</p>

<p>“His father?” she murmured.</p>

<p>Craven Black bowed, while he regarded her and her<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
surroundings curiously. The dingy, poverty-stricken
little room, with its meagre plenishing and no luxuries,
struck him as being but one remove from an alms-house.
The young wife, in her wretchedly poor attire, with her
big black eyes and brown face, from which all color had
been stricken by his announcement, seemed to him a
very commonplace young person, quite of the lower
orders, and he wondered that his university bred son
could have loved her, and that he still desired to cling to
her and his poverty, rather than to leave her and wed an
heiress.</p>

<p>For a moment or more Lally remained motionless and
stupefied, and then the color flashed back to her cheeks
and lips, and the brightness to her eyes. She could interpret
the visit of Craven Black in but one manner&mdash;as
a token of his reconciliation with his son.</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, I beg your pardon,” she said, arising to her
feet, “but I was sorely frightened. I have been so
anxious about Rufus. I expected him home last night.
And I could not dream that you would come to our poor
home.”</p>

<p>She placed a chair for him, but he continued standing,
hat in hand, and leaned carelessly upon the chair
back. He was the picture of elegance and cool serenity,
while Lally, flushed and excited, glanced down at her
own attire in dismay.</p>

<p>“I understand that Rufus has remained in Kent,” she
said, all breathless and joyous, “and I suppose you have
been kind enough to come to take me to him. I fear I
am hardly fit to accompany you, Mr. Black. We have
been so poor, so terribly poor. But I will be ready in a
moment. Oh, I am so grateful to you, sir, for your
goodness to us. Poor Rufus feared your anger more
than all things else. I know I am no fit match for your
son, but&mdash;but I love him so,” and the bright face drooped<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
shyly. “I will be a good wife to him, sir, and a good
daughter to you.”</p>

<p>“Stay,” said Mr. Black, in a cold, metallic voice. “You
are laboring under a misapprehension, Miss Bird. I am
not come to take you down into Kent. You will never
look upon the face of Rufus Black again.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sir!</em>”</p>

<p>“I mean it, madam. I pity you from my soul; I do,
indeed. It were better for you if you had never seen
Rufus Black. You fancy yourself his wife. You are
not so.”</p>

<p>“Not his wife? Oh, sir, then you do not know?
Why, we were married at St. Mary’s Church, in the
parish of Newington. Our marriage is registered there,
and Rufus has a certificate of the marriage.”</p>

<p>“But still you are not married,” said the pitiless visitor,
his keen eyes lancing the soul of the tortured girl.
“Permit me to explain. My son procured a marriage
license, and he made oath that you and he were both of
age, and legally your own masters. He swore to a lie.
Now that is perjury. A marriage of minors without
consent of parents is null and void, and my consent was
not given. Your marriage is illegal, is no marriage at
all. You are as free and Rufus is as free as if this little
episode had not been.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” moaned the young girl, in a wild
strained voice, sinking back into a chair. “Not married&mdash;not
his wife!”</p>

<p>“You are not his wife,” declared Craven Black mercilessly.
“I cannot comprehend by what fascination you
lured my son into this connection with you, but no
doubt he was equally to blame. He is well born and
well connected. You are neither. A marriage between
you and him is something preposterous. I have no fancy
for an alliance with the family of a tallow-chandler. I<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
speak plainly, because delicacy is out of place in handling
this affair. You are of one grade in life, we of
another. I recognize your ambition and desire to rise
in the world, but it must not be done at my expense.”</p>

<p>“Ambition?” repeated poor Lally, putting her hand
to her forehead. “I never thought of rising in the world
when I married Rufus. I loved him, and he loved me.
And we meant to work together, and we have been so
happy. Oh, I am married to him! Do not say that I
am not. I am his wife, Mr. Black&mdash;I am his own wife!”</p>

<p>“And I repeat that you are not,” said Mr. Black
harshly. “The law will not recognize such a marriage.
And if you persist in clinging to the prize you fancy you
have hooked, I will have Rufus arrested on the charge
of perjury and sent to prison.”</p>

<p>Lally uttered a cry of horror. Her eyes dilated, her
thin chest heaved, her black eyes burned with the fires
that raged in her young soul.</p>

<p>“Rufus has recognized the stern necessity of the case,
and full of fears for his own safety he has given you up,”
continued Lally’s persecutor. “He will never see you
again, and desires you, if you have any regard for him
and his safety, to quietly give him up, and glide back
into your own proper sphere.”</p>

<p>“I will not give him up!” cried Lally&mdash;“never! never!
Not until his own lips tell me so! You are cruel, but
you cannot deceive me. I am his own wife, and I will
never give him up!”</p>

<p>“Read that!” said Mr. Black, producing the note his
son had written. “I presume you know his handwriting?”</p>

<p>He tossed to Lally the folded paper. She seized it
and read it eagerly, her face growing white and rigid
like stone. She knew the handwriting only too well.
And in this letter Rufus confirmed his father’s words,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
and utterly renounced her. A conviction of the truth
settled down like a funeral pall upon her young soul.</p>

<p>“You begin to believe me, I see,” said Mr. Black,
growing uncomfortable under the awful stare of her horrified
eyes. “You comprehend at last that you are no
wife?”</p>

<p>“What am I then?” the pale lips whispered.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me in that way, Miss Bird. Really
you frighten me. Don’t take this thing too much to
heart. Of course it’s a disappointment and all that, but
the affair won’t hurt you as if you belonged to a higher
class in life. It’s a mere episode, and people will forget
it. You can resume your maiden name and occupations
and marry some one in your own class, and some day
you will smile at this adventure!”</p>

<p>“Smile? Ah, God!”</p>

<p>Poor Lally cowered in her chair, her small wan face
so full of woe and despair that even Craven Black, villain
as he was, grew uneasy. There was an appalled
look in her eyes, too, that scared him.</p>

<p>“You take the thing too hardly, Miss Bird,” he said.
“I will provide for you. Rufus must not see you again,
and I must have your promise to leave him unmolested.
Give me that promise and I will deal liberally with you.
You must not follow him into Kent. Should you meet
him in the street or elsewhere, you must not speak to
him. Do you understand? If you do, he will suffer in
prison for your contumacy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven be merciful to me!” wailed the poor
disowned young wife. “See him, and not speak to him?
Meet him and pass him by, when I love him better than
my life? Oh, Mr. Black, in the name of Heaven, I beg
you to have pity upon us. I know I am poor and humble.
But I love your son. We are of equal station in the<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
sight of God, and my love for Rufus makes me his equal.
He loves me still&mdash;he loves me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do not deceive yourself with false hopes,” interposed
Craven Black. “My son recognizes the invalidity
of his marriage, and has succumbed to my will. If you
know him well, you know his weak, cowardly nature.
He has agreed never to speak to you again, and, moreover,
he has promised to marry a young lady for whom
I have long intended him&mdash;”</p>

<p>A sharp, shrill cry of doubt and horror broke from
poor, wronged Lally.</p>

<p>“It is true,” affirmed Craven Black.</p>

<p>The girl uttered no further moan, nor sob. Her wild
eyes were tearless; her white lips were set in a rigid
and awful smile.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I feel as if I were going mad!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“You will not go mad,” said Craven Black, with an
attempt at airiness. “You are not the first woman who
has tried to rise above her proper sphere and fallen
back to her own detriment. But, Miss Bird, I must have
your promise to leave Rufus alone. You must resume
your maiden name, and let this episode be as if it had
not been.”</p>

<p>“I shall not trouble Rufus,” the poor girl said, her
voice quivering. “If I am not his wife, and he cannot
marry me, why should I?”</p>

<p>“That is right and sensible. Here are fifty pounds
which may prove serviceable if you should ever marry,”
and Mr. Black handed her a crisp new Bank of England
note.</p>

<p>The girl crumpled it in her hand and flung it back to
him, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“You have taken away my husband&mdash;my love&mdash;my
good name!” she panted. “How dare you offer me
money? I will not take it if I starve!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Black coolly picked up the note and restored it
to his pocket.</p>

<p>He was about to speak further when the door was
burst violently open, and the landlady, flushed with
excitement, came rushing in like an incarnate tornado.
The rejection of the money by Lally had incensed her
beyond all that had gone before.</p>

<p>“I keep a respectable house, I hope, Miss,” snapped
the woman. “I’ve heard all that’s been said here, as is
right I should, being a lone widow and a dependent upon
the reputation of my lodging-’us for a living. And
being as you an’t married, though a pretending of it, I
can’t shelter you no longer. Out you go, without a
minute’s warning. There’s your hat, and there’s your
sack. Take ’em, and start!”</p>

<p>Lally obeyed the words literally. She caught up her
out-door apparel, and with one wild, wailing cry, dashed
out of the room, down the stairs and into the street.</p>

<p>Mr. Black and the landlady regarded each other in a
mutual alarm.</p>

<p>“You have driven her to her death, Madam,” said
Craven Black excitedly. “She has gone out to destroy
herself, and you have murdered her.”</p>

<p>He put on his hat and left the house. The girl’s flying
figure had already disappeared, and the villain’s
conscience cried out to him that she would perish, and
that it was <em>he</em>, and none other, who had killed her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HOW NEVA RECEIVED THE FORGERIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>While Craven Black was successfully pursuing his
machinations to destroy the happiness of two young
lives, Lady Wynde had been active in carrying out her
part in the infamous plot against Neva. The little
packet of forged letters which had cost Lady Wynde’s
fellow-conspirator a night of toil, and which had been
sent to Hawkhurst by a special messenger, had been
safely delivered into the hands of Mrs. Artress, who had
been waiting at the gate lodge to receive it. It had so
happened that not even the lodge keeper had witnessed
the reception of the packet, and she had dismissed the
messenger, and carefully concealed the packet upon
her person, and returned to the house and to the presence
of her mistress.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde had not yet risen. She lay in the midst
of her white bed, with her black hair tossing upon her
ruffled pillow, one white and rounded arm lying upon
the scarlet satin coverlet, and with a profusion of
dainty frills and laces upon her person. A small inlaid
table stood at her bedside, supporting a round silver
tray, upon which gleamed a silver <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tete-a-tete</i> set of the
daintiest proportions, and at the moment of her companion’s
entrance her ladyship was sipping her usual
morning cup of black coffee, which was expected to tone
and strengthen her nerves for the day.</p>

<p>She dropped her tiny gold spoon, and looked up
eagerly and expectantly, and Artress, closing the door,
drew forth the packet with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>“I have received it,” said the gray companion, “and<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
no one is the wiser for it. The messenger thinks it a book,
and the people at the lodge did not even see it. We are
in the usual luck, Octavia. Everything goes well with
us.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that Craven did not fail me,” murmured
Lady Wynde. “I feared he might find the task too
heavy for him. But he is always prompt. Open the
packet, Artress.”</p>

<p>The companion obeyed, bringing to light the double
letter, the one Craven Black had forged being securely
lodged within the last letter Sir Harold Wynde had
written to his wife from India.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde saw that the inner letter, addressed to
Neva, was securely sealed, read the forged postscript to
the letter addressed to her, and placed both under her
pillow, with a complacent smile.</p>

<p>“Craven is a clever fellow,” she muttered. “And how
much he loves me, Artress. Not many men could have
seen the woman they loved marry another, but Craven
and I have been worldly wise, and we shall reap the reward
of our self-denial. If we had married three years
ago, we should have been poor now, mere hangers on
upon the outskirts of society, tolerated for the sake of
our connections, but nothing more. But we determined
to play a daring game, and behold our success. I am
again a widow, with four thousand a year and a good
house while I live, and I can lay up money if I choose
while I continue the chaperon of my husband’s daughter.
And if our game continues to prosper, and Neva
marries Rufus Black, Craven and I will make ten thousand
a year more for the remainder of our lives. Rufus
will have to sign an agreement giving us that amount
out of Neva’s income. Think of it Artress; fourteen
thousand a year!”</p>

<p>“Of which if you win it, I am to have five hundred,”<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
said Artress, her gray face flushing. “And if you do not
win the ten thousand, I am to have two hundred pounds
a year settled upon me for life. Is not that our bargain?”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde nodded assent.</p>

<p>“And,” continued Artress, “I am to enter society with
you, to remain with you as your guest instead of companion.
I have been necessary to you in playing this
game. I have lived with you some three years now, and
though people know that I am a lady born, no one suspects
that I am own cousin to Craven Black, and soon to
be your cousin by marriage. We have joined our forces
and wits together in this game, and we shall enjoy our
success together.”</p>

<p>This, then, was the secret of the connection between
the two women so unlike each other, yet so in unison in
their schemes. Mrs. Artress was the cousin of Craven
Black, and being poor as well as unscrupulous, she was
his most faithful ally in his stupendously wicked schemes.
The interests of the three conspirators were indeed identical.</p>

<p>“I believe I will rise,” said Lady Wynde. “I am impatient
to give this letter to Neva, and to see how she
receives it. Do you suppose she is up?”</p>

<p>“She has been up these two hours,” answered Artress.
“She has been all over the house, has talked with the
butler and the servants, has visited the stable and gardens,
and has even been into the park. She means to
assert her dignity as mistress of Hawkhurst, and to win
the hearts of her dependents, so that in case she disagrees
with you they will support her.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde frowned darkly.</p>

<p>“Miss Neva is not yet of age, and so, although she
owns Hawkhurst, there may be a question whether she is<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
its mistress, or whether I, who am her guardian and her
father’s widow, am mistress here.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship pulled the bell cord at her bed head,
summoning her maid. Artress retired into Lady Wynde’s
sitting-room, and upon the appearance of her attendant,
the widow arose and attired herself in a white morning
wrapper with crimson trimmings, and put upon her head
a small square of white lace adorned with crimson bows.
She had some time since discarded her widow’s cap, as
“too horribly unbecoming.”</p>

<p>She ascertained that Neva was now in her own rooms,
and took her way thither, the forged letters in her hand.
Neva was alone when her step-mother, after a preliminary
knock upon the door, entered her sitting-room, and
she greeted Lady Wynde with a smile and look of welcome.</p>

<p>Neva was looking very lovely this morning, flushed
with her early exercise, her red-brown eyes strangely
brilliant, her red-brown hair arranged in crimps and
braids. She wore a simple dress of white lawn, made
short to escape the ground, and her ribbons and ornaments
were of black. Lady Wynde fancied that Neva’s
half-mourning attire was a reproach to her, and this
fancied reproach, coupled with Neva’s bright, spirited
beauty, gave an impulse to her incipient dislike to the
girl.</p>

<p>A vague jealousy of Neva’s youth and loveliness had
found place in her heart on the previous evening. Now
that faint spark became fanned into a burning flame.
She aspired to be a social queen, and here under her very
roof, and under her chaperonage, was a girl whom she
felt sure would eclipse her. She would not be known in
society as the handsome Mrs. Black, but as the chaperon
of the beautiful Miss Wynde.</p>

<p>But, despite her anger and jealousy, nothing could<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
have been more bland and affectionate than the greeting
of Lady Wynde to her step-daughter. She kissed her
with seeming tenderness, and caressed her bright hair as
she said:</p>

<p>“How animated you look, my dear&mdash;fairly sparkling!
I should fancy that you have an electric sort of temperament&mdash;all
fire and glow. Is it not so? You remind me
of your father, Neva. It will be very sweet to have you
with me, but my grief at my husband’s awful death has
been so great that until now I could never bear to look
upon his daughter’s face. I fancied you would look even
more like him, and I could not have borne the resemblance
in my first grief.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde sighed deeply, and sat down upon the
blue silken couch, drawing Neva to a seat beside her.</p>

<p>“I have come in to have a long confidential talk with
you, my child,” resumed her ladyship. “There should be
between you and me strangely tender relations. Your
poor dear father desired us to be all the world to each
other, and for his sake, as well as your own, I intend to
be a true and good mother to you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, madam,” said Neva, gravely, yet gratefully.
“I will try to deserve your kindness, and to be a
daughter to you.”</p>

<p>“You do not call me mother,” suggested Lady Wynde,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>The young girl colored, and her brilliant eyes were
suddenly shadowed. Her scarlet lips quivered an instant,
as she said gently:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, dear Lady Wynde, but one has but one
mother. I love my dead mother as if she were living,
even though I know her only through my dear father’s
description of her. I cannot give you her name, and I
think it would hardly be appropriate. You are too young<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
to be called mother by a grown-up girl. Does it not
seem so to you?”</p>

<p>“Possibly you are right. Suit yourself, my dear. I
seek only your happiness. I can be a mother to you,
even if you decline to give me the name.”</p>

<p>“And I can equally be a daughter to you, dear Lady
Wynde,” said Neva. “We shall be like sisters, I trust.
And I desire to say that I hope you will consider yourself
as fully mistress of Hawkhurst as when poor papa
was here. I shall not interfere with your rule here, even
if I may, until I attain my majority. While I live, my
home shall be a home to my father’s widow.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, my dear. All these things will
settle themselves hereafter. I have now to deliver to
you a last message from your dear father&mdash;a message,
as I might say, from the grave. Your father’s voice
speaks to you from the other world, my dear Neva, and
I know that you will heed its call.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship drew forth the packet of letters, and laid
them on Neva’s knee.</p>

<p>“You have there,” continued Lady Wynde, putting her
handkerchief to her eyes, “the last letter I ever received
from my dear husband. You may read it. You will see
that he had a presentiment of his approaching death; that
a gloom hung upon him that he could not shake off. That
letter was written the night before his tragic death.”</p>

<p>Neva opened the letter with trembling hands and
read it, even to the postscript upon the last page which
had been forged by the cunning hand of Craven Black.
Her tears fell as she read it.</p>

<p>“The inclosure&mdash;ah, you have not seen it,” said Lady
Wynde&mdash;“is the letter alluded to in that last page of the
letter to me. You see that it has never been opened.
It is a sealed document to me in every sense, although,
as poor Sir Harold often told me of his secret wishes in<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
regard to your future, I have some suspicion of its contents.
Your father requested me should he die in India,
to give you this letter one year after his death. The
appointed time has now arrived, and I deliver into your
hands the last letter your father ever wrote, and which
contains his last sacred wishes in regard to you. You
are to receive it as an addendum to his will, as a sacred
charge, as if his voice were speaking to you from his
home in Heaven!”</p>

<p>She lifted the sealed letter, laying it in Neva’s hands.</p>

<p>The young girl received it with an uncontrollable
agitation.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I must read it alone,” she said brokenly.</p>

<p>“Very well, dear. Go into your dressing-room with
it, and when you have finished reading it come back to
me. I have more to say to you.”</p>

<p>Neva departed without a word, and went into the adjoining
room. As the door closed behind her, Lady
Wynde softly arose, crossed the floor, and peeped in
upon the young girl’s privacy through the key-hole of
the door.</p>

<p>Neva was alone in her dressing-room, and was kneeling
down before a low chair upon which she had laid
the forged letter, as yet unopened. The baronet’s widow
watched the girl as she examined the address and the
seal, and then cut open the top of the letter with a pocket-knife.
Neva unfolded the closely written sheet, all
stamped with her father’s monogram, and with low sobs
and tear-blinded eyes began to read the letter, accepting
it without doubt or question as her father’s last letter
to her.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde’s eyes gleamed, and a mocking smile
played about her full, sensual lips, as Neva read slowly
page after page, still upon her knees, now and then
pausing to kiss the handwriting she believed to be her<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
father’s. The forger’s work had been well done. The
tender pet names by which Sir Harold had loved to call
his daughter were often repeated, with such protestations
of affection as would most stir a loving daughter’s
heart when receiving them long after the death of her
father, and believing them to have been written by that
father’s hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! poor, poor, papa!” the girl sobbed. “He
foresaw my loneliness and desolation, and left these last
words to cheer me. I will remember your wishes so
often expressed in this and other letters. I will be kind
and gentle and obedient to Lady Wynde. I will try to
love her for your sake.”</p>

<p>When she had grown calmer, Neva read on. As she
read that her father had a last request to make of her,
she smiled through her tears, and murmured:</p>

<p>“I am glad that he has left me something to do&mdash;whatever
it may be. I should like to feel that I am
obeying him still, although he is in Heaven. Dear papa!&mdash;your
‘request’ is to me a sacred command, and I shall
so consider it.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde’s eyes glittered like balls of jet. She
had estimated rightly the childlike trust of Neva in her
father’s love and devotion to her.</p>

<p>“She accepts the whole thing as gospel!” thought
the delighted schemer. “Our success is certain. But
let me see how she takes it, when she finds what the
‘request’ is.”</p>

<p>Neva perused the letter slowly, and again and again,
with careful deliberation. Her surprise became apparent
on her features, but there was no disbelief, no distrust,
betrayed on her truthful face. But a wan whiteness
overspread her cheeks and lips, and a weary look came
into her eyes, as she folded the letter at last and hid it
in her bosom. She bent her head as if in prayer, and<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
murmured words which Lady Wynde tried in vain to
hear. They were simple&mdash;only these:</p>

<p>“It is very strange&mdash;very strange; but papa meant it
for the best. He feared to leave me unprotected, and a
prey to fortune-hunters. Who is this Rufus Black? Oh,
if papa had only mentioned Lord&mdash;Lord Towyn!”</p>

<p>The very thought brought a vivid scarlet to Neva’s
face in place of her strange pallor, and as if frightened at
her own thought, she arose and went to the open window,
and leaned upon the casement.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde stole back to her couch, and she was sitting
upon it the picture of languor when Neva returned,
very pale now and subdued, and with a shadow of trouble
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Have you finished your letter so soon, dear?” asked
the step-mother, sweetly. “I believe I can guess what
were the last injunctions to you of your dear father. He
often told me of his plans for you. Shall you do as he
desired?”</p>

<p>Again the glowing scarlet flush covered Neva’s cheeks,
lips, even her slender throat.</p>

<p>“My father’s last wishes are a command to me,” she
said, slowly, yet as if her mind were quite made up to
obey the supposed wishes of her father.</p>

<p>“It was Sir Harold’s request that you should marry a
young man in whom he took considerable interest&mdash;one
Rufus Black, was it not?” asked Lady Wynde.</p>

<p>Neva uttered a low assent.</p>

<p>“And you will marry this young fellow?”</p>

<p>“My father liked him well enough to make him my&mdash;my
husband,” said Neva. “I can trust my father’s
judgment in all things. I never disobeyed papa in his
life, and I cannot disobey him now that he seems to speak
to me from Heaven. If&mdash;if Rufus Black ever proposes<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
marriage to me, and if he is still worthy of the good
opinion papa formed of him, I&mdash;I&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice broke down, as she remembered the fair,
boyish face, the warm blue eyes, the tawny hair and
noble air of Lord Towyn, and again with inward shame
the question framed itself in her mind&mdash;why could not
her father have recommended to her affection young Arthur
Towyn, whom her father had loved next to his own
son? Why must he desire her to marry a man she had
never seen?</p>

<p>“You will marry Rufus!” demanded Lady Wynde, as
the girl’s pause became protracted.</p>

<p>Neva bowed her head&mdash;she could not speak.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde’s face glowed, and an evil light gleamed
in her eyes. Her heart throbbed wildly with her evil
triumph.</p>

<p>“You are indeed a good and faithful daughter, Neva,”
she said caressingly. “In accordance with your father’s
wishes, I must give Mr. Black every chance to woo you.
I believe he knows something of what Sir Harold designed
for you and him, and he is at this moment at
Wyndham village. He is staying at the inn with his
father, and both will call upon you this evening.”</p>

<p>“So soon?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better. I have not seen Rufus Black,
but his father called here last evening. The father
knew poor Sir Harold intimately. And, Neva, dear, in
honor of your guests, and in deference to my wishes, you
ought to lay aside all vestige of your mourning to-day.
You have worn black a year, and that is all that modern
society demands.”</p>

<p>“The outward garb does not always indicate the feelings
of the heart,” said Neva. “I will change my manner
of dress, since you desire it, but I shall mourn for
papa all my days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>As Neva became thoughtful and abstracted, Lady
Wynde soon took her leave. She found Artress in her
sitting-room and the gray companion had no need to
ask of her success.</p>

<p>“Our silly little fish has swallowed the bait,” said
Lady Wynde. “She is ready to immolate herself ‘for
dear papa’s sake,’ although I could see that she is already
interested in Lord Towyn. I am impatient for evening.
I want to see how young Rufus Black will proceed in
his task of winning the heiress of Hawkhurst.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE MEETING OF NEVA AND RUFUS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The hours of his father’s absence in London were full
of an insupportable suspense to Rufus Black. He was
tempted to hurry up to town by the next train, and only
his weakness and cowardice prevented him from flying
to the succor of his wronged young wife. His terror of
his father was a lion in his way. And the act of perjury
he had committed in declaring himself of age when obtaining
his marriage license&mdash;an act more of thoughtlessness
and boyish ardor than of deliberate lying&mdash;arose
now between him and poor Lally like a wall of iron.
He had erred, and must accept the consequences, but he
thought to himself that he would give all his hopes of
heaven if Lally might have been spared his punishment.</p>

<p>Anguished and despairing, he put on his hat and
hurried out into the street, eager for fresh air and for
action. He passed out of the little hamlet, seeing no
one, and wandered into the open country, where a noble<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
park bordered one side of the road, and fair green fields
stretched far away upon the other. Both park and fields
belonged to the domain of Hawkhurst, but Rufus Black
was unconscious of the fact until he came out in full
view of the great gray stone house throned upon the
broad ridge of ground, and set in its parks and gardens
like some rare jewel in its setting.</p>

<p>Then he recognized the place, and muttered moodily:</p>

<p>“So, this is what I am to sell my soul for? A goodly
price, no doubt, and more than it is worth. The owner
of all this wealth cannot go begging for a husband, be
she ugly as Medusa. Perhaps, after all, I have been
troubling myself for nothing. She may not choose to
accept a shabby young man, without a penny in his
pocket, and with a gloomy face. If she refuses me, I
dare say that father will let me go back to Lally.”</p>

<p>This thought afforded him some comfort, and he
plodded on, seeking relief from his troubles in exertion.
He cared not whither he went, and his surprise was
great when at last, arousing from his abstraction, he
found himself in the streets of Canterbury.</p>

<p>He was near an inn of the humbler sort, and, with a
sudden recklessness as to what became of him, he turned
into the low barroom and demanded a private parlor.
A bare little apartment on the upper floor, overlooking
the inn stables, was assigned him. The floor was uncovered,
and a deal table, rush-bottomed chair and
rickety lounge made up the sum of the furniture.</p>

<p>Rufus called for brandy and water, tossing a shilling
to the frowsy waiter. A decanter of brandy and a bottle
of water were brought to him, and he entered upon
a solitary orgie. He had not been used to drink, and
the fiery liquid mounted to his brain, inducing stupidity
and drunkenness. For an hour or two he drank with
brief intermission, but sleep overpowered him, and his<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
head fell upon the table and he snored heavily. With
his red face, dishevelled hair and stertorous breathing,
his unmistakable aspect of drunkenness, he presented a
terrible contrast to the hopeful boy artist with his honest
eyes and loving soul, who had made the dingy lodging
in New Brompton a very paradise to poor Lally.</p>

<p>The day wore on. A waiter looked in upon the poor
wreck, once or twice, and went away each time chuckling.
In the latter part of the afternoon Rufus awakened,
and came to himself. Ashamed and conscience-stricken,
his first thought being of what Lally would
think of him, he summoned a waiter and demanded
strong coffee and food. These were furnished him, and
having partaken of them he settled his bill, and set out
to walk back to Wyndham.</p>

<p>“It makes no difference what becomes of me now,” he
said to himself, as he strode along the return route. “I
have started down hill, and I may as well keep on
descending.”</p>

<p>He had accomplished half the distance between Canterbury
and his destination, when a four-wheeled cab,
traveling briskly, came up behind him, compelling him
to take to the side path. The next moment the cab
stopped, and Craven Black’s head was protruded from
the open window, and Craven Black’s smooth voice
called:</p>

<p>“Is that you, Rufus? What are you doing away out
here? Jump in! jump in!”</p>

<p>Rufus obeyed, entering the vehicle, and the cabman
drove on.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” demanded the elder Black,
as the son settled himself upon the front seat and opposite
his father.</p>

<p>“I have spent the day in Canterbury,” returned Rufus
sullenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“What have you been doing there?”</p>

<p>“Getting drunk,” was the dogged answer.</p>

<p>The young man’s face testified to his truthfulness.
His eyes, wild in their glances, were bloodshot and
watery, and he had a reckless air, as if he had thrown
off all restraints of virtue and decency.</p>

<p>Craven Black experienced a sense of alarm. He began
to fear lest his son would defeat all his plans by his
obstinacy and recklessness.</p>

<p>“You do not ask me about the girl,” said the father,
with more gentleness than was usual to him. “I have
seen her.”</p>

<p>“I supposed you had,” was the reply. “I gave you
her address.”</p>

<p>“I told her the truth,” said Craven Black, puzzled by
his son’s strange mood. “I explained to her kindly
enough that her marriage with you was no marriage at
all. She readily accepted the situation. She cried a little,
to be sure, but she said herself that she was of lower
rank than you, and that the match was too unequal.
She&mdash;she said that of course all was over between you,
and it was best you and she should never meet again.
And in fact, to render any such meeting impossible, she
left her lodging while I was there.”</p>

<p>Rufus fixed a burning gaze upon his father.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word you say,” he cried. “The
news you carried to her broke my darling’s heart. Do
you suppose I do not know how much she loved me? I
was all she had in the wide world&mdash;her only friend.
Think of that, sir! Her only friend&mdash;and you have torn
me from her. If she dies of grief, you are her murderer.”</p>

<p>Craven Black shuddered involuntarily, remembering
poor Lally’s flight, and his conviction that she had<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
gone to destroy herself. His emotion did not pass unnoticed
by his son.</p>

<p>“Poor Lally!” said Rufus, his voice trembling. “It’s
all over between us forever. I have blighted her life,
ruined her good name, and made her an outcast. Yet
it was not I who did this. It was you. Her blood be
upon your head. If I could find her and were free to
woo her, she would never take me back, now that I have
proved myself a liar, perjurer and pitiful wretched coward.
It is indeed all over between us. You can do what
you like with the wreck you have made me. You might
have given me a chance to redeem myself; you might
have let me be true to her, but you would make me
perjure myself doubly. I hope you are pleased with
your work.”</p>

<p>“Let there be an end of these silly boyish reproaches,”
exclaimed Mr. Black harshly. “You have done with the
girl, and are about to enter upon a new life. I have
generously forgiven your errors and crimes. If you repeat
the drunkenness of to-day, I’ll send you to prison.
Try me, and see if I do not. I have brought you a trunk
from London, filled with new clothing from your tailor,
shirt-maker, boot-maker and jeweller. I have spared no
expense to make you look as my son should look. And
now, by Heaven, if you disgrace me to-night by any
recklessness and folly, any mock despair, I’ll prosecute
you on that charge of perjury.”</p>

<p>“You need not fear that I shall disgrace myself, or
insult my hostess,” said Rufus doggedly. “You think
no one has the instincts of a gentleman save yourself.”</p>

<p>With such recriminations as these, the pair beguiled
their drive to Wyndham; nor did they cease from them
after their arrival in Mr. Black’s private parlor. A sullen
silence succeeded in good time, and reigned throughout<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
the dinner, of which they partook together. After
dinner, they retired to their several rooms to dress.</p>

<p>The trunk Mr. Black had brought from London had
been deposited in his son’s chamber. Rufus had the
key, and unlocked the receptacle, bringing to light an
ample supply of fine garments, perfume cases, a dressing
case, and a set of jewelled shirt studs in a little velvet
case.</p>

<p>He arrayed his boyish figure in his new black garments,
noticing even in his despair that they fitted him
as if he had been measured for them. He waited in his
room until his father came for him, and submitted sullenly
to his father’s careful inspection.</p>

<p>“You’ll do,” commented Craven Black. “If you act
as well as you look, I shall be satisfied. Mind, if you
mention to Miss Wynde one word about the girl Lally,
it’s all up with you. The cab is waiting. Come on!”</p>

<p>They descended together to the cab, and were conveyed
to Hawkhurst. On arriving at the mansion, they
alighted, and entered the great baronial hall, sending in
their cards to Lady Wynde by the footman. The baronet’s
widow having signified to her domestic that she
was “always at home” to Mr. Black and his son, the
visitors was ushered into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde and Artress arose to receive them. Craven
Black presented his son, and the baronet’s widow
welcomed the young man graciously. She was looking
unusually well this evening in a robe of pale amber silk,
with a row of short locks trimmed squarely, nursery
fashion, across her low polished forehead, a long black
curl trailing over each shoulder, and her cheeks glowing
with suppressed excitement. Rufus remembered having
seen her before her marriage to Sir Harold Wynde, and
his face brightened as at the sight of a friend.</p>

<p>He was acquainted, although slightly, with his father’s<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
cousin, Mrs. Artress, and as he held out his hand to her,
he looked his surprise at seeing her at the house of Lady
Wynde.</p>

<p>“I am her ladyship’s hired companion,” said Artress,
explainingly. “My husband left me very poor, you know,
Rufus, and I have been in dear Lady Wynde’s employ
for some three years. I beg you not to recognize me as
a relative, nor to mention the fact to any one. I have my
family pride, you know, Rufus, and it is hard to be
obliged to earn one’s own living when one has not been
brought up to it.”</p>

<p>Her reasons for concealment of the relationship existing
between them seemed to Rufus no reasons at all, but
he could not gainsay her wishes, and muttered that he
would obey her.</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde has gone out for a solitary stroll in the
park,” observed Lady Wynde, as Mr. Black’s eyes wandered
about the room. “I sent her out for the fresh air.
She is not looking well, I regret to say. Mr. Rufus, if
you will be kind enough to go down the wide park
avenue, you cannot fail to find her. I beg you will
introduce yourself to her, and bring her back to the
house.”</p>

<p>Rufus bowed, and stepping lightly out of the open window,
moved leisurely toward the park.</p>

<p>“There is nothing like an informal meeting,” said
Lady Wynde, looking after the young man. “I planned
to have the meeting occur in this way, so that neither
should be embarrassed by the presence of a third
party.”</p>

<p>“I should have preferred to keep my eye upon Rufus,”
remarked Mr. Black uneasily. “Did you give the letter
to the young lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she received it exactly as I had expected she
would. She is not at all the style of girl I looked for,<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
Craven, and it is fortunate for our plans that she cared so
much for her father.”</p>

<p>While the conspirators were thus conversing, Rufus
crossed the lawn and entered the park by a small gate.
The wide avenue, a fine carriage drive, was readily found,
and Rufus walked for some distance upon it, keeping a
vigilant look-out for Miss Wynde. He was beginning to
meditate upon a return to the house without the young
lady, when a flutter of white garments among the dusky
shadows of a side path caught his gaze. He plunged
into the path without hesitation, and presently overtook
the wearer of the garments, who was of course Miss
Wynde.</p>

<p>Hearing his swift approach, she halted and turned her
face toward him. Rufus also halted, strangely embarrassed
under her brave full glance. She had laid aside
her mourning garments, and wore rose-colored ribbons
and a profusion of frills and puffs and lace, in which she
looked very fair and dainty and sweet. Her wine-brown
eyes were all aglow, but her cheeks were pale, and her
face was very grave, even to sadness.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Rufus awkwardly, raising
his hat. “I am looking for Miss Wynde.”</p>

<p>“I am Miss Wynde,” said Neva, with gentle courtesy.</p>

<p>The young man’s embarrassment was not lessened by
this announcement.</p>

<p>“Lady Wynde sent me to look for you,” he declared.
“I&mdash;I am Rufus Black!”</p>

<p>Neva started and looked at him with her grave, serious
eyes. He appeared to advantage in his new garments,
and his face was pale and worn by the day’s dissipation.
His sorrows and his sickness had given him a
refined look to which he was not fully and fairly entitled,
and his eyes met hers frankly and honestly, with a
real admiration in their gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>Neva’s cheeks flushed slightly, and her heart fluttered.
Clearly Rufus Black had not made an unfavorable impression
upon her in that first glance.</p>

<p>They turned and walked slowly up the path together,
entering the avenue. Rufus tried to conquer his unwonted
awkwardness, and singularly impressed with
Neva’s beauty, exerted himself to please her. They
sauntered on, stopping now and then to gather ferns or
flowers, and when they emerged from the park upon the
lawn, they were chatting gayly, and on the best of terms
with each other.</p>

<p>And yet the heart of each was strangely sore. Neva
thought of what “might have been,” and sighed in
her inmost soul that the husband her father was supposed
by her to have chosen for her was not the one her
heart most longed for. And Rufus mourned as bitterly
as ever in his soul for his lost young wife, and felt that
he should never be comforted.</p>

<p>Craven Black and Lady Wynde watched them as they
approached the house, and the lip of the former curled,
as he muttered:</p>

<p>“So fade the griefs of the young! Unstable as water,
Rufus is already this girl’s lover!”</p>

<p>“They are mutually pleased,” murmured Lady
Wynde. “Her father’s supposed wishes and this young
man’s interesting melancholy will soon efface Lord
Towyn’s image from Neva’s mind, if it has made any
impression there.”</p>

<p>It seemed indeed as if the opinion of the worldly-wise
conspirators would be justified.</p>

<p>The young couple halted upon the lawn, and Neva’s
gravity and the melancholy of Rufus began to disappear,
when the lodge gates swung open, and three gentleman
came riding up the avenue.</p>

<p>The long twilight had begun, and even Neva’s keen<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
eyes could not recognize the new-comers at that distance,
and she chatted merrily to Rufus, who answered
as lightly. But as the horsemen came nearer, and Neva
regarded them more closely, a sudden silence fell upon
her, and a strange shyness seized her.</p>

<p>It was a critical movement in the progress of the
game which Craven Black and Lady Wynde were playing,
and these new-comers had arrived in time to give
a new turn to it.</p>

<p>For Neva recognized them as the three guardians of
her property&mdash;Sir John Freies, Mr. Atkins, and the
young Lord Towyn!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MR. BLACK GETS A NEW IDEA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As Neva recognized the youngest of her three guardians,
as they rode up the avenue of Hawkhurst at a
leisurely pace, a strange embarrassment seized upon
her. The horsemen had not yet seen her in the twilight
and the shadow of shrubbery, and she proposed a
return to the drawing-room. Rufus Black assented,
and they passed in at the open French window which
gave directly upon the marble terrace.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was full of shadows. Artress sat
in a recessed window, silent and immovable, and Lady
Wynde and Craven Black were in the second portion of
the triple arched apartment, completely hidden from
view, and their low whispers barely penetrated to the
outer room. Lady Wynde, hearing her step-daughter’s
return, came forth, rang for lights, and ordered the lace
curtains to be dropped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>A score of wax candles were presently glowing in their
polished silver sconces, and a couple of moon-like lamps
dispensed a mellow radiance that penetrated to every
corner of the triple room. The curtains, fluttering in
the soft night breeze, shut out all insects, but admitted
the perfumed air. Craven Black, satisfied that his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tete-a-tete</i>
with Lady Wynde was over for the present, sauntered
into the outer room to make the acquaintance of
the young heiress.</p>

<p>He had thought of Neva as an insipid, affected, weak-headed
young lady, who would be a mere puppet in his
hands and those of Lady Wynde. His surprise may be
imagined when he beheld a slender, spirited girl, with
eyes of red gloom, brown hair tinted with the sunshine,
scarlet lips, and a piquant face, full of an irresistible
witchery and sauciness&mdash;a girl so bright and keen of
intellect, so resolute and strong in herself, that he wondered
that she could ever have been imposed upon by
even his skilfully forged letter.</p>

<p>“Neva, my dear,” said Lady Wynde, “allow me to
present to you the Honorable Craven Black&mdash;one of your
dear papa’s friends, and consequently yours and mine.”</p>

<p>Neva acknowledged the introduction by a bow of her
haughty little head, and a smile so warm and sweet that
Craven Black was captivated by it. Any friend of her
late father’s had a peculiar claim upon Neva’s friendship,
and Craven Black resolved to elaborate the small
fiction, and coin agreeable little anecdotes of his relations
to her father, so that the heiress would be inspired
with a liking for him.</p>

<p>Before time had been granted for more than the usual
commonplaces incident to an introduction, the three
guardians of Miss Wynde were announced by the footman,
and were ushered into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Sir John Freise came first&mdash;a tall, stately old gentleman,<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
with white hair and closely cropped whiskers, distinguished
for his old-fashioned courtliness of bearing,
and noted throughout Kent for his unswerving integrity.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins, the attorney, came next, looking more
than ordinarily insignificant of person, his bald head
shining, his honest face flushed to redness. He was not
fine looking, nor well shaped, but, like Sir John, he was
a man of invincible integrity and honesty of character,
and many years of service to Sir Harold Wynde had
inspired him with a genuine affection for the family, and
given him, as one might say, a personal interest in its
prosperity.</p>

<p>Lastly, and because he preferred to come last, was
young Lord Towyn, as handsome as any knight of chivalry,
his golden hair tossed back from his noble forehead,
his blue eyes glowing, and a warm smile playing
about his tawny mustached lips.</p>

<p>Neva recognized her guardians, and welcomed them
all in turn with handshakings and quiet greetings. Lady
Wynde introduced the Blacks, father and son, to the
new-comers.</p>

<p>“This is scarcely a business visit, Miss Neva,” said Sir
John Freise, leading his young hostess to a sofa with old-fashioned
gallantry. “Lord Towyn and Mr. Atkins have
been closeted with me to-day, discussing your affairs in
the way of rents and leases, but it is our business to
spare you these details, and it is your province to enjoy
the fruits of our labors,” and he smiled paternally upon
her. “We are come to welcome you back to the home
of your fathers, and to express the hope that you will
fill worthily the place your father has resigned to you.”</p>

<p>“I will try to walk in papa’s steps,” returned Neva,
lowly and gravely.</p>

<p>“Lady Freise and my girls will call upon you to-morrow,”
said Sir John. “They sent their love to you,<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
and would have come to-day, but that I begged them to
allow you a day to rest in after your journey. You will
be inundated with visitors, Miss Neva. The Lady of
Hawkhurst will not be permitted to hide her light under
a bushel! Lady Freise has already projected no end of
fetes, balls and dinners in your honor, and she has persuaded
our young friend Lord Towyn to spend a month
with us, so that you will not lack an escort, should you
desire one.”</p>

<p>“You are very thoughtful, Sir John,” said Lady
Wynde, with a curl of the lip. “Miss Wynde, however,
can never lack for an escort. I fancied, when I saw you
three gentlemen enter in such formidable array, that
some horrid red-tape business was about to be transacted.
I did not know indeed but that you had come
with some official suggestions as to the management of
the household, or to discuss the matter of pin-money.”</p>

<p>“All that is settled by Sir Harold’s will,” said Mr.
Atkins quietly. “The baronet was very explicit in his
directions, and assigned to Miss Wynde an extraordinarily
liberal allowance until she comes of age, when, of
course she comes into full possession of her magnificent
revenues. Your residence at Hawkhurst was also provided
for, Lady Wynde with a very handsome allowance
in recognition of your services to Miss Wynde as friend
and chaperon.”</p>

<p>“And are we compelled to remain at Hawkhurst,
whether we will or not?” demanded the baronet’s
widow.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Atkins. “You and Miss
Wynde are free to reside where you please, but it is
natural to suppose you will prefer for a stated residence
the seat of the family grandeur.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde made no reply, but her glittering eyes
became speculative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>The visitors, while courteous to her ladyship, bestowed
the larger share of their attention upon the young heiress
to whom their visit was directed. They had intended
to make but a brief call, but the time flew by as if on
wings. Neva talked with them with cheerful gayety or
gravity, as the subject rendered befitting, and at Sir
John’s request played and sang for him. Lord Towyn
leaned over the piano, turning the music leaves, a rapt
expression on his face, and there was not one present,
save Neva, who failed to see that he was already the
lover of the beautiful young heiress.</p>

<p>Rufus Black recognized the fact with an actual jealousy.
He said to himself with a furious bitterness that
his happiness and Lally’s had been ruined for the sake
of Neva Wynde, and he would not be cheated of fortune
and bride by the young earl.</p>

<p>Craven Black sat apart, his forehead shaded by his
hand, his light eyes fairly devouring the glowing loveliness
of Neva’s face. He was a world-worn, base, dissolute
man, incapable of honor and fidelity, even to
the woman who had sinned and perilled so much for
him. As he sat there, he contrasted Neva’s spirited and
dainty beauty with the maturer and lesser charms of
Lady Wynde, and strange thoughts and hopes awoke to
life within his breast.</p>

<p>“My fate is not so settled as to be irrevocable,” he
thought within himself. “I wish I had seen the girl
before I forged that letter. Why should I throw myself
away upon four thousand a year and a woman of
the world when, by skillful manœuvring, I might gain
seventy thousand per annum and a bride like an houri?
I will study my chances. If there is a chance for me
with Neva, I will run the race with these others and win
the prize.”</p>

<p>And so, all unknown and unsuspected by Neva, she<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
had three aspirants to her hand among those who listened
to her music.</p>

<p>And of these three lovers, one only was pure and true
and altogether worthy of her love. Only one loved her
without a shadow of greed, and that one was the young
Lord Towyn.</p>

<p>But which, should she choose among these three,
would she prefer? To whose fate, of these three, would
she link her own? Would a regard for the supposed
wishes of her dead father outweigh the desires of her
own heart? These were problems which time alone
could solve.</p>

<p>After the music, Lady Wynde rang for coffee, which
was brought in and dispensed to the guests. Sir John
Freise, waxing eloquent upon the degeneracy of modern
society, held Lady Wynde captive. Rufus Black wandered
down the length of the drawing-rooms, looking
with an artist’s eye at the glorious pictures upon the
walls. Mr. Atkins and Craven Black engaged in conversation,
and Artress sat apart, silent and observing, as
usual.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn and Neva also looked at the pictures
and talked of their childhood days, growing animated
over their pleasant reminiscences. The young earl
gradually drew his hostess into the great conservatory,
a huge glass dome at the bottom of the drawing-room.
Here the air was heavy with fragrance. Stalks of white
lilies sprang from the side walls, bearing pistils of red
and dancing light. Aisles of tropical shrubbery, thick
with golden fruitage or snowy blossoms, or both at once,
stretched on either side. A feathery palm reared its
plumed head in the very centre of the dome. Vines
trailed and festooned themselves from floor to roof,
dropping perfume from fiery chalices. And through
the light foliage of a well-trimmed jungle of flowers and<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
leaves, gleamed a great mellow moon of light, reminding
one of a Brazilian forest on a moonlit summer night.</p>

<p>“Do you remember when we were here last, Neva?”
asked Lord Towyn, as they paused beside the marble
basin of a great fountain, and Neva idly dropped rose
petals upon the crystal waters. “We were standing
upon this very spot, with only that marble Naiad to
hear us, and you and I were but children when we
entered upon our childish betrothal. How long ago
that seems! Do you remember it, Neva?”</p>

<p>The rose petals in the girl’s white fingers were not
brighter than her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” she said, dropping her head over
the bright waters. “What precocious children we were,
Lord Towyn.”</p>

<p>The young earl sighed.</p>

<p>“The utterance of my title shows the great gulf between
the now and the then,” he said. “I was no lord
in those days, and you called me Arthur. Now when
your name comes instinctively to my lips, I must remember
that you are no longer Neva, but Miss Wynde.
Why will you not call me by the old name, and let us
take up our old friendship where we left off, instead of
beginning anew as strangers?”</p>

<p>“I am willing,” said Neva frankly, yet shyly. “I&mdash;I
look upon you as a brother, Arthur, and you may call
me Neva.”</p>

<p>Strange to say, the permission thus granted did not
seem to delight Lord Towyn. His warm blue eyes
clouded over with a singular discontent, and a pained
expression gathered about his mouth.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be considered as your brother,
Neva,” he declared, after a minute’s struggle with himself.
“I would prefer to begin again as your merest acquaintance.
A fraternal relation toward you would<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
be insupportable. For years I have dreamed and hoped
that I might some time win your love. I am no longer
a boy, Neva, and I love you with a man’s love. I have carried
your picture for years next my heart. I have worshiped
you in secret ever since our childhood. I do not know
how I have been betrayed into this confession, Neva,” he
added. “I did not intend to be so premature. I do not
yet ask you to love or to marry me, but I do ask you to
allow me to become your suitor.”</p>

<p>Neva’s heart thrilled under this ardent and impassioned
declaration as under an angel’s touch. Then a leaden
pall seemed to descend upon her soul, and her face grew
white, as she faltered:</p>

<p>“It cannot be, Arthur.”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn shivered with sudden pain.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you are not promised to another, Neva?”</p>

<p>“N-no!”</p>

<p>“You love another then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!”</p>

<p>“It is that I have startled you by my premature confession,
Neva?” he cried tremulously. “Dolt that I am!
I have thought and dreamed of you so much, that I had
forgotten how perfect a stranger I must seem to you
after all these years of separation. You cannot take up
the old life where we dropped it. I was foolish to have
expected it. Do not let my undue haste prejudice you
against me. It will not, Neva?”</p>

<p>“No, Arthur,” answered the girl lowly and hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“And you will give me a chance to reprieve my error?”
he demanded eagerly. “Perhaps in time you may grow
to love me, Neva&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Arthur,” said the young girl, nerving herself to tell
him of her father’s supposed last wishes, “I have something
to say to you. Papa&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>Her voice died out in a half sob.</p>

<p>“Well, darling?” said the young earl, bending nearer
to her, his eyes burning with the love that filled his being.
“What of Sir Harold? Did you fancy that he would
not have approved of our love?”</p>

<p>Neva nodded a dumb assent.</p>

<p>“And if Sir Harold had approved, do you think you
could learn to love me?” whispered the young earl softly,
his eager breath fanning the girl’s cheek.</p>

<p>Neva’s silence was interpreted as a favorable answer.</p>

<p>“Before my father died,” said Lord Towyn gently,
“he told me that it had long been his wish and that of
Sir Harold to unite the two families in our marriage.
Sir Harold was in India at the time of my father’s death,
and was not likely, at that distance from home, to have
contracted an aversion to me, or to have formed other
plans for your future. You see, I am right, Neva, and now
I claim to be considered as your suitor. May it not be?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur,” the girl murmured, sorely perplexed,
“I&mdash;”</p>

<p>The story trembled on her lips, but she did not give
utterance to it, for at that critical moment Rufus Black
entered the conservatory, and came up the flower-bordered
aisle, with an unmistakable displeasure upon his
melancholy face.</p>

<p>Neva started guiltily at his approach, as if she had been
wronging him or her dead father in listening to Lord
Towyn’s avowals of love. But although she moved away
from the young earl, she paused under a tropical rose-tree,
and began to gather roses, and her two suitors hovered
about her, each recognizing in the other a rival.</p>

<p>They were presently joined by Neva’s third lover,
Craven Black. The last-named looked moodily and
jealously at his son and the young earl, and devoted
himself so closely to the heiress that, with a feeling of<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
annoyance, Neva presently proposed a return to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>A glance of jealous anger from the eyes of Lady
Wynde greeted Craven Black as he reentered the presence
of his betrothed. The baronet’s widow began to
entertain a suspicion of the disaffection of her lover.</p>

<p>Sir John Freise was the first to propose a departure,
and the horses were ordered, and he, with Mr. Atkins
and Lord Towyn, took their leave.</p>

<p>Craven Black exchanged a few whispered words with
Lady Wynde, appointing an interview for the next
morning, and then also departed with his son.</p>

<p>They were to walk to Wyndham, and not a word was
spoken by either as they strode down the wide avenue,
and passed out at the lodge gates. Once out upon the
highway, Craven Black broke the silence, saying:</p>

<p>“Well, Rufus, how do you like Miss Wynde?”</p>

<p>“She is beautiful&mdash;lovely beyond comparison,” answered
Rufus enthusiastically. “I never saw a being
so witching, so bright, so sweet!”</p>

<p>“You talk like a lover,” sneered Craven Black. “One
would not believe that you had been lying drunk all day
at a low inn through love for another woman.”</p>

<p>“You will drive me mad!” ejaculated Rufus, his voice
choking suddenly. “How dare you taunt me with my
misery and degradation? I did love Lally&mdash;I do love
her, God knows. But you have separated us. She despises
me, and I am thrown upon myself. Why grudge
me the little comfort Miss Wynde’s presence and smiles
give me? If I had never met Lally, I should have idolized
Miss Wynde. And as Lally can never be mine
again&mdash;my poor wronged girl&mdash;and I shall go to perdition
unless some hand pulls me back, I turn to Miss
Wynde as a drowning man might turn to any frail support<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
and cling to it. I&mdash;I like her. I could almost say
I love her.”</p>

<p>“Enviable elasticity of youthful affections!” sighed
Craven Black, still sneeringly, and speaking in a stilted
voice. “You remind me of a child, Rufus, whose doll is
smashed to-day, but who is equally content with a new
one to-morrow. You remind me also of the old maid’s
prayer. She wanted one man and another, but as the
years went on and she grew old, she ceased to pray for
the affections of any man in particular, but cried out,
‘Any, O Lord, <em>any</em>!’ And so, I judge, one woman is to
you the same as another. It is ‘Lalla Rookh’ one day,
and Miss Wynde the next. ‘Extremes meet.’”</p>

<p>Rufus grew terribly angry.</p>

<p>“You talk as if you were dissatisfied with me for obeying
your own orders to make myself agreeable to Miss
Wynde,” he ejaculated. “Do you want her now for
yourself?”</p>

<p>Mr. Black hastened to disclaim any such desire.</p>

<p>“As to me,” said Rufus, with unwonted decision, “I
will not be much longer dependent upon you. I will
win Miss Wynde and her fortune, or I’ll blow my brains
out. Lally is lost to me, but all is not lost, as I thought
this morning. I like Miss Wynde. I even love her
already, strange as it may seem, but I do not and cannot
love her as I love poor Lally. But I shall marry her
and make her happy. I am desperate, but by no means
helpless and hopeless.”</p>

<p>Mr. Black maintained a dogged silence during the
remainder of the walk. He bade his son good-night
coldly upon the inn stairs, and locked himself in his own
rooms, muttering:</p>

<p>“The girl has three lovers, for my fickle son really
loves her. I must watch my chances, and not loosen my
hold upon Octavia until I have made sure of Neva. In<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
default of the greater prize, I must not lose the lesser. It
requires some skill to sit upon two stools and not fall between
them. I wish I could have foreseen the turn affairs
would take, and had inserted my name in that forged letter
in place of my son’s name. I shall have to be pretty
keen to do away with the effect of that letter. I would
give all I own in the world at present to know which
of her three lovers will win the heiress of Hawkhurst.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">RUFUS ASKS THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Craven Black and his son met at their late breakfast in
the private parlor of the former. The father was himself
again, cold, polite, and cynical. The son was sullen and
irritable, at war with himself and all mankind. His grief
for the loss of his young wife had lost none of its poignancy,
although he had avowed himself the suitor of another.
His thoughts during the night just passed had
been all of Lally, and not of Neva. In his dreams at
least, he was still true to the loving heart he had
broken.</p>

<p>The pair were sipping their coffee when a waiter
brought in Mr. Black’s morning paper, just arrived from
London. Craven Black unfolded the sheet and scanned
its contents lazily.</p>

<p>“Any news?” inquired Rufus.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular. It’s all about a war in prospect
between Prussia and France. I never read politics, so I’ll
skip the French letter and alarming head lines. I prefer
to read the smaller items. Ah, what is this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>Craven Black started and changed color as his eye
rested upon a familiar name in an obscure paragraph,
under a startling title. His agitation increased as he
glanced over the paragraph, taking in its meaning.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Rufus. “Any of
your acquaintance dead? Any one left you a fortune?”</p>

<p>“It is terrible,” said Craven Black, shuddering, and regarding
the paper with horrified eyes. “How could she
have been so utterly foolish and insane? It was not I
who killed her.”</p>

<p>“Killed whom? Then some one is dead?”</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” muttered Craven Black, still staring at
the paper with wide eyes, as if he read there an accusation
of wilful murder. “Poor Lally&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<em>Who?</em>”</p>

<p>Rufus leaped to his feet with a shriek on his lips,
bounded to his father’s side, and snatched the paper in
his trembling hands.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I see nothing,” he cried. “You shocked me cruelly.
I&mdash;I thought that Lally&mdash; Oh, my God!”</p>

<p>He stood as if suddenly frozen, staring as his father
had done at an item in a lower corner of the paper&mdash;an
item which bore the title: “Distressing Case of Suicide.
Another unfortunate gone to her death!”</p>

<p>From the midst of this paragraph the name of Lalla
Bird stood out with startling distinctness.</p>

<p>Unconsciously to himself, Rufus Black read the brief
paragraph aloud in a hoarse, strained, breathless sort of
voice, and his father listened with head bent forward,
and with a horrified look graven on his face, as upon
stone.</p>

<p>“Last evening,” the notice read, “as officer Rice was
pursuing his usual beat, a young woman dashed past him,
bonnetless, her hair flying, and ran out upon Waterloo
Bridge. She was muttering wildly to herself, and her<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
aspect was that of one beside herself. The officer, comprehending
her purpose, rushed after her, but he was too
late to arrest her in her dread purpose. She looked back
at him, sprang up to the parapet like a flash, and with
a last cry upon her lips&mdash;a name the officer could not
make out&mdash;she precipitated herself into the river. In
falling, her head struck a passing boat, mutilating her
features beyond all semblance of humanity. She was
dead when taken from the water, and will have a pauper’s
burial unless some one comes forward to claim her
remains. No token of her identity was found upon her
person, but her handkerchief, floating on the water and
picked up immediately by a boatman, bore the name of
Lalla Bird. The girl, for she was very young, was
pretty, and without doubt belonged to that frail class
which more than any other furnishes us suicides.”</p>

<p>Rufus Black read this paragraph to the very end, and
then the paper fell from his nerveless hands.</p>

<p>“Dead!” he said hollowly. “Dead!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” echoed his father hoarsely.</p>

<p>“<em>Dead!</em>” said Rufus Black, turning his burning, terrible
eyes upon his father’s face. “And it was you who
killed her! I loved her&mdash;I would have been true to her
all her days, but you tore us asunder, and drove her to
despair, madness and death. You are her murderer!”</p>

<p>Craven Black started, nervously, and looked around
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Rufus&mdash;don’t,” he ejaculated uneasily. “Some
one might hear you. The girl is to blame for killing
herself, and no one else can be held accountable for
it. I offered her money but she would not take it. It
was the landlady who drove her to the&mdash;the rash act.
The old woman listened at the door, and suddenly burst
in upon us and called the girl some foul name and<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
ordered her out of her house. The girl fled as if pursued
by demons. I thought then she meant to kill herself&mdash;just
as she has done!”</p>

<p>A groan burst from Rufus Black’s lips.</p>

<p>“My poor, poor wife!” he moaned. “She <em>was</em> my
wife, and she shall not lie in a pauper’s grave. I am
going up to London&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To make a fool of yourself,” interrupted Craven
Black, recovering from his shock. “And to-morrow
morning the papers will all come out with the romantic
story that this girl was your wife, and the story will stick
to you all your days. People will say that you drove
her to her death. Your chance of becoming master of
Hawkhurst will end on the spot. You will be cast out
and abhorred. Others as pretty and as good as this girl
have been buried at the public expense. Leave her alone.”</p>

<p>“I cannot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Suppose you go then? What will you say to the
coroner, or police justice? What excuse will you have
for abandoning your wife, as you persist in calling the
girl? Shall you confess your perjury? Can you stand
the cross-questioning, the badgering, the prying into
your life and motives?”</p>

<p>Rufus shrank within himself in a sort of terror. The
besetting weakness and cowardice of his nature now
paralyzed him.</p>

<p>“I cannot go,” he muttered. “Oh, Lally, my lost
wronged wife!”</p>

<p>He dashed from the room, and entered his own, locking
his door, and was not visible again that day.</p>

<p>Craven Black attired himself in morning costume and
walked over to Hawkhurst. Neva was in the park, and he
had a long private interview with Lady Wynde. In returning
to his inn, he crossed the park, ostensibly to cut<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
short his walk, but really to exchange a few words with
the heiress.</p>

<p>He found her in one of the wide shaded paths, but she
was not alone. Lord Towyn, on his way to the house,
had just encountered her, and they were talking to each
other, in utter forgetfulness of any supposed obstacles to
their mutual love. Craven Black accosted them, and
lingered a few moments, and then pursued his way
homeward, while the young couple slowly proceeded
toward the house.</p>

<p>Craven Black called at Hawkhurst the next day, and
the next, but alone, Rufus remaining obstinately sequestered
in his darkened chamber. Neva was busy with
visitors, Lady Freise and her daughters, and other friends
and neighbors, hastening to call upon the returned
heiress. Lord Towyn found excuses to call nearly every
day. He was devoting all his energies to the task of
wooing and winning Neva, and he pushed his suit with
an ardor that brought a cynical smile to Craven Black’s
lips continually.</p>

<p>There were fetes given at Freise Hall in Neva’s honor;
breakfast and lawn parties at other houses; and the
young girl found herself in a whirl of gayety in strong
contrast with her late life of seclusion.</p>

<p>During the week that followed the publication of the
announcement of Lally Bird’s suicide, Rufus Black did
not cross his threshold. He meditated suicide, and wept
and bemoaned his lost darling with genuine anguish.
During this week, Craven Black made various overtures
to Miss Wynde, uttered graceful compliments to her
when Lady Wynde was not within hearing, and threw a
lover-like ardor into his tones and countenance when
addressing her. But he could not see that he was regarded
by her with any favor, and grew anxious that
his son should again enter the lists, and win her from<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
Lord Towyn, who seemed to be having the field nearly
to himself.</p>

<p>After an energetic talk with his son, Craven Black
persuaded Rufus to emerge from his retirement and to
again visit Hawkhurst. There is a refining influence about
grief, and Rufus had never looked so well as when, habited
in black, his face pale, thin, and sharp-featured, his
eyes full of melancholy and vain regret, he again called
upon Neva. The impression he had made upon her
upon the occasion of his first visit had been favorable,
and it became still more favorable upon this second
visit. Neva received the impression, from his steady
melancholy and the occasional wildness of his eyes, that
he was a genius, and became deeply interested in him.</p>

<p>Add to this interest the influence of the forged letter,
which she devoutly believed to have been written by her
father now dead, and one will see that even Lord Towyn
had in the boy artist a dangerous rival.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde steadily pursued her preparations for
her marriage, keeping a keen watch upon her lover,
whom she more than suspected of faithlessness to her.
She loved him with all her wicked soul, and was anxious
to secure him in matrimonial chains, but her engagement
to him had not yet been announced, and even Neva
did not know of it.</p>

<p>By the exercise of Lady Wynde’s influence, the Blacks,
father and son, were invited to all the parties given in
Neva’s honor, and Rufus Black and Lord Towyn were
ever at the side of the young heiress. Lady Wynde
hinted judiciously to a few of her chosen friends that
Neva and young Black were informally betrothed, but
that the betrothal was still a secret.</p>

<p>As the summer passed and September came, bringing
near at hand the time appointed for the marriage of
Lady Wynde and Craven Black, both the Blacks, father<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
and son, became uneasy and restless. The former was
anxious to try his fate with Neva before committing
himself beyond retrieval with her step-mother. Rufus
had learned to love the heiress with a genuine love, not
as he had loved Lally, but still with so much of fervor
that he believed he could not live without her. His
grief for his young wife had not lessened, but time had
robbed the blow of its sharpest sting, and he thought
of Lally in heaven, while he coveted Neva on earth. He
grew anxious to put his faith to the test.</p>

<p>A favorable opportunity was afforded him.</p>

<p>Neva was fond of walking, and frequently took long
walks, despite the fact that she had carriages and horses
at command. One mild September evening, after her
seven o’clock dinner, she walked over to Wyndham village
to purchase at the general dealer’s some Berlin
wool urgently required for the completion of a sofa pillow,
or some such trifle, and sauntered slowly homeward
in the gloaming.</p>

<p>Rufus Black, who was idly wandering in the streets
at the time, hurried after her and offered his escort, and
took charge of her parcel. They walked on together.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the village into the open country,
Rufus felt that the hour had come in which to learn
his fate from Neva’s lips. He revolved in his mind a
dozen ways of putting the momentous question, but the
manner still remained undecided when Neva sat down
to rest upon a way-side bank in the very shadow of
Hawkhurst park.</p>

<p>This bank was her favorite halting-place when going
on foot to or from Wyndham. It was shaded by a giant
oak, and clothed in the softest and greenest turf. Here
the earliest primroses blossomed and hearts-ease starred
the ground. Near the bank a small private gate opened
into the park. Rufus decided in his own mind that this<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
was the spot, and this soft, deepening twilight the hour
for the avowal of his love.</p>

<p>There was no one within the park within view to interrupt
him; no one coming along the road. With a
slight sense of nervousness he even surveyed a way-side
thicket that flanked the bank upon one side, as if fearing
some way-side tramp might be lurking there within
hearing, but he saw nothing to discountenance his projects.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely evening,” said Neva softly, looking up
at the shadowing sky and around her at the shadowed
earth. “The air is full of balm!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is lovely,” said Rufus, fixing his gaze upon
the young girl, as if he meant his remark to apply to
her face. “How the time has sped since I first saw you,
Miss Neva. Life was very dark to me in those July
days, but you have given it a glow and brightness I did
not dream that it could ever possess. It seems to me
that I never existed until&mdash;until I knew you. You cannot
fail to know that I love you. I have often thought
that you have purposely encouraged my suit. But be
that as it may, I love you more than all the world, Miss
Neva. Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>He waited in a breathless suspense for her reply.</p>

<p>Neva’s face did not flush with joy, as it might have
done had the speaker been Lord Towyn. She looked
very grave, and into her eyes of red gloom came a sadness
that was terrible to see.</p>

<p>“I like you, Rufus,” she said gently, looking beyond
him with a strange, far-seeing gaze. “I believe you to
be good and honorable&mdash;would to God I did not&mdash;for
then&mdash;then&mdash;Rufus, I do not know what to say to you.
What shall I answer you?”</p>

<p>“Say Yes,” pleaded Rufus, with the energy of a gathering
terror. “Do not refuse me, Neva, I implore you. I<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
am not handsome and titled like Lord Towyn; I am
plain and awkward, but I love you with all my soul.
I place my fate in your hands. I have it in me to become
great and good, and if you will be my wife I will be
noble for your sake. But if you cast me off, I shall
perish. In you are centred all my hopes. Oh, Neva, I
beseech you to be merciful to me, and to save me from
the utter misery of a life without you. I cannot&mdash;cannot
live if you cast me off!”</p>

<p>He spoke with an earnestness that went to Neva’s soul.
She trembled, as if the burden of responsibility laid
upon her were too heavy to be borne. In her uplifted
eyes was a wild, beseeching look, as if she called upon
her father from his home in heaven to aid her now.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said Rufus desperately, “you are deciding
upon my life or death&mdash;mortal and physical!”</p>

<p>Neva read in the declaration an awful sincerity that
made her shudder.</p>

<p>“I must think,” she faltered. “I cannot decide so
suddenly. Give me a week, Rufus&mdash;only a week in
which to decide. Oh,” she added, under her breath,
with a passionate emphasis, “if papa only knew! He
would have spared me this.”</p>

<p>Rufus assented to the delay with a beaming face. If
she had intended to refuse him, he thought, she would
have done so on the spot. But she had not refused
him, and there was hope. She should be his wife, and
he would be master of Hawkhurst yet.</p>

<p>In the midst of his self-gratulations, Neva arose and
walked slowly onward, grave and sorrowful. Rufus
walked beside her with a joyous tread.</p>

<p>When they had passed on into the thickening shadows,
and the primrose bank had been left far behind, a
ragged, childish figure stirred itself from the further
shadow of the thicket, and a childish face, wan and<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
thin and haggard, with a woman’s woe in the great
dark eyes, looked after the young pair with an awful
horror and despair.</p>

<p>That face belonged to the disowned young wife whom
Rufus mourned as dead! The wild and woful eyes were
the eyes of Lally Bird!</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE YOUNG WIFE’S DESOLATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was indeed poor Lally Bird, the wronged young
wife, whom her husband mourned as dead, who, crouching
in the shelter of the way-side thicket, stared after
Neva Wynde and Rufus Black with eyes full of a burning
woe and despair.</p>

<p>“He loves her! He loves her!” the poor young creature
moaned, in the utter abandonment of her terrible
anguish. “He said her answer meant life and death to
him! And I am so soon forgotten? Oh, he never loved
me&mdash;never&mdash;never! And he does love her with all his
soul&mdash;O Heaven!”</p>

<p>She sank back into the deeper shadow of the thicket,
moaning and wringing her hands.</p>

<p>Her hat had fallen off, and her face was upturned to
the gray evening sky. That face, still childlike in its
outlines and in its innocence, yet sharp of feature, wan,
thin and haggard, was full of wild beseeching. The
great hungry black eyes were upraised to Heaven in
agonized appeal.</p>

<p>How terribly alone in all the wide world she was! Alone
and friendless, with no roof to shelter her, no food to<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
break a long fast, no money. She was ragged and forlorn,
her feet peeping from their frail coverings, her
sharpened elbows protruding through her sleeves. And
now her last hope had been dashed from her, and it
seemed as if nothing remained to her but to die.</p>

<p>The story of her life from the moment in which she
had fled from her dingy lodgings at New Brompton, had
been one of bitterness and privation.</p>

<p>When she had escaped from her only shelter, half
maddened and wholly despairing, with the voices of
Craven Black and Mrs. McKellar yet ringing in her ears,
her first impulse had been self-destruction. She had
sped along the streets until, by a circuitous route, she
had gained the river and a jutting pier, but it was daylight,
and people were in waiting for the boats, so her
dread purpose was checked, and she wandered on, wild
of face and half distraught, keeping the river ever in
sight, as if the view of its waters soothed her mad despair.</p>

<p>Wandering aimlessly onward, she passed through foul
river streets, where the vile of every sort congregated,
but no one spoke to her or molested her. The shield of
a watchful Providence interposed between her and all
harm. Once or twice some ruffian would have accosted
and stayed her, but a glance into her white and rigid face
and wild unseeing eyes made him shrink back abashed,
and she sped on as if pursued, not knowing the dangers
she had escaped.</p>

<p>She grew weary of foot, and to the wildness of her
anguish succeeded a merciful apathy, which steeped her
senses. The night came on; the gas lamps were lighted
in the streets; the warehouses and shops were closed,
there were fewer women in the streets; and in happy
homes in the suburbs, at the north and south and east
and west of the great teeming city, wives and daughters<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
were gathered into pleasant homes. But she had no
home, no refuge, no shelter. She had&mdash;oh, saddest of
words, and saddest of meaning&mdash;she had nowhere to
go!</p>

<p>And so she plodded on, slowly and wearily now. She
had traversed miles since leaving her lodgings, and it
seemed as if her march, like that of the fabled Wandering
Jew, must be eternal.</p>

<p>At last, still wandering without aim, she staggered
through the turn-gate and out upon the Waterloo Bridge,
in the wake of a party of returning play-goers. No one
noticed her, and she passed half-way over the bridge
and sank down upon one of the stone benches, while
the party she had followed went on and were soon lost
to view in the Waterloo Road.</p>

<p>She was alone on the bridge, in the night and darkness.
Below her lay the dark river, with the small
steamers puffing and glancing through the gloom with
their tiny eyes of fire, and lowering their stack-pipes as
they passed under the bridge. A few people stood at
the landing below. Somerset House, dark and silent,
like some gigantic mausoleum, lay to her left. Along
the river banks were the great warehouses, long since
closed for the night, and in the distance the dome of St.
Paul’s reared its head, faint and shadowy, among the
deeper shadows.</p>

<p>The glancing lights of the river boats, the lamps at the
landing and along the shores looked strangely unreal to
Lally’s dazed eyes. She crouched in a corner of the
seat and peered over the parapet and tried to think, but
her brain seemed paralyzed. The only thought that
came to her was that she was no wife, that Rufus had
abandoned and disowned her, and that he was to marry
another.</p>

<p>People crossed the bridge in laughing groups as the<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
Strand theatres and concert-halls closed, but no one paid
heed to, even if they saw, the slender, crouching figure
with its wild, fearing eyes. Sometimes, for many minutes
together, Lally was alone upon that portion of the
bridge&mdash;alone with her desperate soul and her terrible
temptation to end her sorrows in one fatal plunge.</p>

<p>She arose in one of these intervals to her feet upon
the bench and leaned over the parapet, a prayer upon
her lips that Heaven would forgive the deed she meditated.
And, as she stood poised for the leap into eternity,
there came back to her, though years had passed
since she heard it, the voice of her mother, as she had
once listened to it, denouncing the self-murderer as one
who destroys his soul as well as his body. The remembrance
of the words, and the thought of her mother,
caused her to drop again into the corner of her bench
sobbing, and weeping a storm of tears that saved her
reason.</p>

<p>The wild outburst of her anguish had been succeeded
by a strange dullness and apathy, when a woman&mdash;a
mere girl&mdash;“bonnetless, and her hair flying,”&mdash;as the
Blacks had read in the paper&mdash;came running upon the
bridge with moans upon her lips. Lally was as pure
and innocent as a little child, yet she knew at a glance
that this poor creature belonged to that class which is
often termed “unfortunate”&mdash;as Heaven knows they
are indeed, in every sense of the sad word. This girl
came up to the very niche where Lally was hidden, and
sprang upon the bench. She gave one wild look over
her shoulder, at the officer who pursued her, and then,
with the name of some man upon her lips, tossed up her
arms, and sprang over the parapet&mdash;into eternity!</p>

<p>Lally uttered a cry of horror.</p>

<p>“It might have been me!” was her first thought, and<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
trembling and terrified, she looked over at the whirling
figure as it struck heavily upon the passing boat.</p>

<p>And in the same instant Lally’s handkerchief, upon
which her name was marked, and which she had held in
her hand, dropped over the parapet upon the body of
the woman. That accident it was that changed poor
Lally’s destiny. For the poor suicide was she of whose
death Rufus Black read in the paper of the following
morning, and Lally’s handkerchief found upon the
water beside the dead girl gave the impression that the
suicide was Lally Bird.</p>

<p>The presence of Lally upon the bridge escaped the
notice of the officer, who turned and ran along the
bridge to the end, and hurried down to the pier, whither
the rescued body of the suicide was being carried.</p>

<p>People began to gather upon the bridge, seeming almost
to spring up miraculously, and Lally, fearing questioning,
or detention as witness of the suicide, arose and
went back by the way she had come, up Wellington
street, into the Strand. She was sufficiently herself by
this time to know that she must seek shelter for the
night; but where could she go? What respectable inn
would give shelter to one so forlorn of aspect, so utterly
alone as she? She would be driven forth as something
disreputable and unclean, should she demand lodgings
at such an inn. She had money in her pocket&mdash;the
share Rufus had given her of the ten pounds his father
had sent him&mdash;but she might almost as well have been
penniless, since her money could not procure her respectable
shelter for the night.</p>

<p>There might be some home for friendly wanderers,
some asylum for respectable women, where she could
pass the dangerous hours of darkness, but she knew of
none. Such asylums are generally for reclaimed women,
not for those who have never gone astray. The<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
omnibuses were still running, it not being yet midnight,
and Lally being too tired to walk further, signalled an
empty one and took her seat in it.</p>

<p>A long ride followed over rough pavements, past
dingy rows of shops and houses, past small villas in
small gardens, looking like toy establishments, and
through a more sparsely settled region. Lally, overcome
with fatigue, dozed most of the time, and was
rudely awakened from her slumbers by the stopping of
the omnibus and the rough voice of the driver bidding
her alight.</p>

<p>She got out, feeling quite dazed, and saw that the
omnibus had stopped at the end of its route, and that
the horses were already unhitched and being led into the
stable. She crept away, not knowing where to go, not
even knowing where she was.</p>

<p>Plodding on wearily, now and then clinging to some
way-side fence or wall for a moment’s rest, she came out
upon a wide, deserted heath, open to whoever might
choose to camp upon it. This was Hampstead Heath.
She walked out upon the turf for some distance, and lay
down in the shelter of a furze patch, thinking she was
going to die. The skies were dark above her, and all
around her the black gloom brooded, covering her from
the sight of any tramps who might be taking their sleep
that summer night on that same broad common.</p>

<p>And here Lally slept the sleep of utter weariness. She
awakened at the dawn of the new day, and started up,
with a wild look around her.</p>

<p>There were donkeys of diminutive breed grazing
around her, a few tramps rising lazily from the ground,
and a score of industrious people, men, women, boys and
girls, digging up groundsel, chickweed and other green
weeds, to sell in the great city for the sustenance of
birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>Lally wonderingly surveyed this species of industry of
which she had not previously suspected the existence,
and then hastily took her departure, not even tempted
to prolong her stay by the offer of some bread and cheese
from an old, blackened chimney-sweep, who had evidently
also slept upon the heath.</p>

<p>All thoughts of self-destruction had gone from her
mind, and the question as to her future course now presented
itself. The school with which she had formerly
been connected as music teacher was broken up, and
among the few people she had known there was one only
to whom she was tempted to go in her distress. That
one was an old, consumptive woman who had been
“wardrobe mistress” at the seminary during Lally’s stay
there&mdash;that is, the old woman had mended and darned
the garments of the pupils, and had supported herself
on her meagre pay. She lived at Notting Hill, the school
having been located in that neighborhood, and Lally
knew her address. The old woman had been kind to
her, and Lally resolved to seek her.</p>

<p>She walked a portion of the distance, and availed herself
of the aid of omnibuses when she could. Yet the
morning was well on when the girl climbed the rickety
stairs to the garret of her old friend, and timidly knocked
for admittance.</p>

<p>The old woman was at home, busy with her needle,
and gave Lally admittance. More&mdash;when she heard her
pitiful story&mdash;she gave the girl sympathy and the
tenderest kindness. She was very near her grave, and
very poor, but she offered Lally a share of her home, and
the girl gratefully accepted it. Here she ate breakfast.
During the day her old friend borrowed a copy of the
morning’s paper, as was her daily custom, and Lally read
in it the account of the suicide on Waterloo Bridge, her<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
name being given&mdash;to her utter amazement&mdash;as that of
the self-murderess.</p>

<p>Having a conviction that Rufus would see the same
notice, as indeed he had done, she visited the coroner’s
office with a yearning to see her young husband
as he should bend over the poor mutilated body believing
it to be her own, and to relieve his anguish and remorse.
But Rufus came not, and the suicide was buried
in a pauper’s grave.</p>

<p>Lally went back to the garret at Notting Hill, with a
strange gloom on her face, and shared the labors of the
old seamstress, gradually assuming the entire support
of her friend, as the old woman’s strength failed. She
did all the sewing her friend&mdash;who was now wardrobe
mistress at a boys’ school&mdash;had engaged to do, and
nursed her with a daughter’s tenderness, actually starving
herself to nourish her only friend, watching by day
and night at her side, denying herself food, clothes, and
needed rest, to take care of the one who had befriended
her; but with all her care and kindness the old woman
faded day by day, and early in September died, invoking
with her last breath blessings on Lally’s name.</p>

<p>The few sticks of furniture were sold to give the old
woman a decent burial. Lally was out of money&mdash;out
of everything. The superintendent of the boys’ school
refused to allow her to continue the duties she had performed
in the old woman’s name, alleging that she was
too young. And as a last blow, she was turned out of
her lodgings because of her inability to pay the rent.</p>

<p>At this crisis of her history, when as it seemed only
death presented an open door to her, she resolved to go
down to Wyndham and look once more on her husband’s
face.</p>

<p>To think, with our desperate Lally, was to act. She
set out to walk to Wyndham, working in the hop-fields<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
for sustenance as she went. Thus she did three full days
of work before she arrived near her destination, and she
had crept into the way-side thicket to rest before continuing
her journey to Wyndham, when she chanced to
overhear the conversation between Neva Wynde and
Rufus Black.</p>

<p>Her despair, as she listened to the words of her young
husband in declaring his love for Neva, may be imagined.
She did not dream how bitterly he had mourned for his
lost young wife; she did not dream that she was dearer
to him still than Neva could ever be. How could she
tell, when listening to his passionate vows of love to Miss
Wynde, that the young wife who had slept in his bosom
was in his thoughts by day and by night, and was regarded
by him as a holy, precious memory?</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” she sobbed, pressing her face down
upon the dewy turf. “I am forgotten&mdash;but why should
I not be? I never was his wife. He said so himself in
his letter to me that I carry still next my heart. Not
his wife&mdash;but <em>she</em> will be! How beautiful she is! How
lovely her face was, how clear her voice. She would pity
me if she knew, but she is an heiress, I dare say, while I
am only the poor outcast Rufus has made me! Oh,
Rufus, Rufus!”</p>

<p>She wailed aloud, but she had learned to bear her
griefs in silence, and presently she struggled to her feet
and walked in the direction in which the heiress and her
lover had gone&mdash;the same way by which Lally had recently
come.</p>

<p>There was no need for her to go to Wyndham now.
Her presence there, or her appearance to Rufus, might
embarrass his relations to his newer love, and possibly
interfere with his marriage. He thought her dead, and
had not even come forward to claim the body he supposed
to be hers. Ah, yes, she had never been his wife,<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
and she was forgotten. She would never cross his path
again.</p>

<p>She staggered wearily along the road, in and out of
the beaten foot-path, with the twilight deepening around
her, and with a deeper twilight settling down upon her
heart and brain. She passed the Hawkhurst park, the
picturesque stone lodge guarding the great bronze gates,
and here she paused.</p>

<p>The lodge was closed, and a faint light streamed out
through the dotted white curtains. Lally crept close to
the great gates formed of bronze spears tipped with gilt,
like the gates of the Tuileries gardens at Paris, and
pressing her face against the cool rods, looked up the
avenue.</p>

<p>At the distance of half a mile or more, the great gray
stone mansion sat throned upon a broad ridge of land,
and lights flared from the wide uncurtained windows
far upon the terrace, and the glass dome of flowers was
all alight, and the stately old house looked to the homeless
wanderer down by the gates like Paradise.</p>

<p>Her eager eyes searched the terrace, and then, inch
by inch, the great tree-arched avenue.</p>

<p>Midway up the avenue, walking slowly, as lovers walk,
she saw her young husband and Neva Wynde. With
great jealous eyes she watched their progress through
the shadows, and, when they paused in the stream of
light upon the terrace, and Rufus Black bent low
toward the heiress, a great flame leaped into poor Lally’s
sombre eyes, and she caught her breath sharply.</p>

<p>The heiress and her suitor stood for some moments
upon the terrace, unconscious of the eyes upon them.
Rufus declined to go into the house that evening, alleging
his agitation as an excuse. Neva took her small parcel
which he had carried, and he seized her hand, uttering
passionate words of love, and begging her to look<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
favorably upon his suit. Then not waiting for an answer,
he pressed her hand to his lips, and dashed down
the avenue toward the gates, while Neva entered the
house.</p>

<p>And all this the jealous, disowned wife saw, with her
face growing death-like, and the flame burning yet more
brightly in her sombre eyes.</p>

<p>“She has accepted him,” she muttered. “She will
not take the week to consider his suit. They are betrothed.
I was sure she lived here. Perhaps she owns
the place, and he will be its master. They will both be
rich and happy and beloved, while I&mdash;Ah, how swiftly
he comes! He walked like that the night <em>I</em> accepted
him. But I am not his wife; I never was, even when I
thought myself so. He must not see me. No shadow
from the past must darken his happy life&mdash;his and hers.
It is all over&mdash;all over&mdash;and I shall never see his face
again!”</p>

<p>With one last, long lingering look, and a sob that
came from her very soul, she turned and sped down the
road like a mad creature&mdash;away from Wyndham, and
Rufus, and all her hopes&mdash;going, ah, where?</p>

<p>And Rufus, with his new love-dream glowing in his
soul, came out of the Hawkhurst grounds, and hurried
toward his inn, never dreaming how near he had been
to his lost wife, nor how surely he had lost her.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ONE OF NEVA’S LOVERS DISPOSED OF.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Upon his return to the Wyndham inn, Rufus Black
found his father awaiting him in their private parlor.
The elder Black arched his brows inquiringly as his son
came in, and Rufus bowed to him gayly, as he said:</p>

<p>“Well, father, you ought to be pleased with me now.
I have offered myself to Miss Wynde.”</p>

<p>Craven Black started.</p>

<p>“She has accepted you?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Not yet. She wants to think the matter over, and I
have consented to let the thing rest where it is for a
week. I take it as a good sign that she did not refuse
me at once. Her hesitation implies a regard for me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or a sense of duty toward some one else,” muttered
Craven Black. “Curse that letter. If I had seen the
girl, I would never have written it.”</p>

<p>“What is it you say, father? I did not catch your
words.”</p>

<p>“They were not meant for your ears. So, Miss Wynde
demands a week in which to consider your offer? It
would be proper for you to refrain from going to Hawkhurst
to-morrow. I’ll explain to her that you remained
away from motives of delicacy.”</p>

<p>“Which I shall not do,” said Rufus doggedly. “I
shall go to Hawkhurst to-morrow evening. I will not
leave the field clear to Lord Towyn. He’s an earl, rich,
handsome, and intellectual, the very man to capture a
girl’s heart, and if I know myself, I am not going to give
him a clear field. Why, he loves her better than I do
even, and I can only come out ahead of him by dint of<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
sheer persistency. It’s a mystery to me how she refrained
from saying No to me, when she can have Lord Towyn
if she chooses. There is something behind her hesitation&mdash;some
hidden cause&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which you will do well to let alone,” interposed his
father. “‘Take the goods the gods provide’ without
questioning.”</p>

<p>Rufus was not satisfied, but concluded to act upon this
advice.</p>

<p>The next morning Craven Black attired himself with
unusual care, and mounted his piebald horse, a new purchase,
and set out alone, at a slow canter, for Hawkhurst.
He knew that the heiress usually took a morning
ride, attended only by her groom, and he knew in
what direction these rides usually lay. It was impossible
for him to demand a private interview with her at
her home without exciting the suspicions and jealousy
of Lady Wynde, and he was determined to see the
heiress alone, and discover in what estimation she held
him. He was also determined not to accept quietly the
four thousand a year of the baronet’s widow until he
knew, beyond all peradventure, that he could not obtain
the seventy thousand per annum of the baronet’s
daughter.</p>

<p>He rode up to Hawkhurst lodge, slackening his speed,
but not pausing. As it happened, a little boy, a son of
the lodge keeper, was playing in the road, and Craven
Black tossed him a sixpence, and demanded if Miss
Wynde were out riding, and which way she had gone.</p>

<p>“Dingle Farm way,” said the urchin, scrambling in
the dust for the shining coin. “She’s been gone a long
time.”</p>

<p>“Who is with her?” asked Craven Black.</p>

<p>“Jim, the groom&mdash;that be all.”</p>

<p>Black put spurs to his horse and dashed on. He knew<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
where the Dingle Farm was, it having been pointed out
to him by Lady Wynde, as a portion of the Hawkhurst
property. The ride was a favorite one with Neva, being
unusually diversified. The road led through the Dingle
wood, across a common, and skirted a chalk-pit of unusual
size and depth.</p>

<p>Craven Black turned off from the main road into a
narrower one that led across the country, and pursued
this course until he entered into the cool shadows of the
Dingle wood. Still riding briskly, he came out a little
later upon the Dingle common, a square mile of unfenced
heath, covered with furze bushes. At the further
edge of the common was the chalk-pit, now disused.
The road ran dangerously near to the precipitous side
of the pit, and there was no railing or fence to serve as a
safeguard. Beyond the chalk-pit lay the Dingle Farm,
a cozy, red brick farm-house, embowered with trees.</p>

<p>The morning was clear and bright, and the sun was
shining. As Craven Black emerged from the shadow of
the wood he swept a keen glance over the level common,
and beheld a mile or more away, beyond the chalk-pit,
but approaching it, the figure of Miss Wynde.</p>

<p>She was superbly mounted upon a thoroughbred
horse, and was followed at a little distance by her
groom.</p>

<p>Even at that distance, Craven Black noticed how well
Neva sat her horse; how erectly she carried her lithe,
light figure; how proudly the little head was poised upon
her shoulders. She was coming on toward him at a
sweeping gait, her long green robe fluttering in the
swift breeze she made.</p>

<p>“She will be a wife to be proud of,” thought Craven
Black, with a strange stirring at his heart. “How fearless
she is. One would think she would pass the<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
chalk-pit at a walk, but it is evident she does not intend
to.”</p>

<p>He dashed on to meet her. Neva saw him coming,
recognized him, and the close grasp upon her bridle
rein relaxed, and the fierce gallop subsided into a quiet
canter.</p>

<p>She was past the chalk-pit when he came up to her,
and she bowed to him coldly, but courteously.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Wynde,” said Mr. Black. “You
were having a mad ride here. I fairly shuddered when
I saw you coming. A single sheer on the part of your
horse would have sent you over the precipice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Badjour and I understand each other,” said
Neva lightly, patting the horse’s proudly arched neck.
“I never ride a horse, Mr. Black, if I have not confidence
in my ability to control him.”</p>

<p>“But the road is so narrow and dangerous at this
point,” said Craven Black, wheeling and riding slowly
at her side.</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Black. The road must be fenced
in. I will speak to Lord Towyn about it.”</p>

<p>“And why not to Sir John Freise or Mr. Atkins, who
are equally your guardians?” asked Craven Black, with
an attempt at playfulness.</p>

<p>“Because I presume I shall see Lord Towyn first,”
replied Neva, gravely. “What do you say to a race, Mr.
Black? I see that you are returning with me.”</p>

<p>Craven Black looked over his shoulder. The discreet
groom had fallen behind out of earshot. Now was the
time to make his declaration of love. Such an opportunity
might not again occur.</p>

<p>“The truth is, Miss Wynde,” he exclaimed, “I came
out to meet you. I want to have a quiet talk with you,
if you will hear me.”</p>

<p>Neva bowed her head gravely, and her reins fell<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
loosely in her gauntleted hand. They were out upon
the wide common now, the Dingle farm behind them.
The Dingle wood ahead.</p>

<p>“You may guess the nature of the communication I
have to make to you, Miss Wynde,” said her elderly
lover, with an appearance of agitation, a portion of
which was genuine. “That which I have to say would
be more fittingly said in some other position perhaps. I
should prefer to say it on my knees to you, as the
knights made love in olden times.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Neva. “Hadn’t we better move on faster,
Mr. Black?”</p>

<p>“Coquettish like all of your sex!” said Craven Black,
drawing nearer to her. “You understand my meaning,
Neva? You know that I love you&mdash;I who never loved
before&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Surely,” cried Neva, with an arch sparkle in her red-brown
eyes, “you did not perjure yourself when you
married the mother of your son?”</p>

<p>Craven Black bit his lips fiercely, but said smilingly:</p>

<p>“That marriage was one of convenience. No love
entered into it, on my side, at least. I never loved till I
met you, fair Neva. You have younger suitors, but not
one among them all who will be to you what I would be&mdash;your
slave, your minister, your subject.”</p>

<p>“And I should want my husband to be my king,”
murmured Neva softly. “And I would be his queen.”</p>

<p>“That arrangement would suit me perfectly,” declared
Craven Black, feeling a little awkward at his
love-making, not altogether sure Neva was not secretly
laughing at him, yet eagerly catching at the assistance
her words afforded him. “I would be your king, Miss
Neva&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused in anger, as the girl’s light laugh made
music in his ears that he by no means appreciated. His<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
anger deepened, as Neva looked at him with a bright
sauciness, a piquant witchery of eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” the girl laughed, “but I do not
think&mdash;pardon me, Mr. Black&mdash;that you are of the stuff
of which kings of the kind I meant are made!”</p>

<p>Craven Black’s fair face flushed. He tugged at his
light beard with nervous fingers. An angry light
glowered in his light eyes.</p>

<p>“I may not know the full meaning of your words,
Miss Neva,” he said, forcing himself to speak calmly.
“A romantic young girl like you is sure to have many
fancies which time will prune. A young girl’s fancy is
like the overflowing of some graceful rose-tree. When
time shall have picked off a bud here, a leaf there, or a
half-blown rose elsewhere, the remainder of the blossoming
will be more perfect. I am no knight of romance,
but I am not aware that there is anything ridiculous
in my face or figure. Ladies of the world have
smiled graciously upon me, and more than one peeress
would have taken my name had I but asked her. My
heart is fresh and young, full of romantic visions like
yours. My love is honest, and a king could offer no
better. Miss Wynde, I ask you to be my wife!”</p>

<p>Neva’s face was grave now, but the sparkle was still
in her eyes, as she said:</p>

<p>“I am sure I beg your pardon, Mr. Black, but I
thought you were a suitor of Mrs. Artress. I never had
an idea that your visits were directed to me. I am
deeply grateful for the honor you have done me&mdash;I suppose
that is the proper remark to make under the
circumstances; the ladies in novels always say it&mdash;but
I must decline it.”</p>

<p>“And why, if I may be allowed to ask?” demanded
Craven Black, his face deepening in hue nearly to<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
purple. “Why this insulting refusal of an honest offer
of marriage, Miss Wynde?”</p>

<p>Neva regarded her angry suitor with cool gravity.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon if the manner of my refusal
seemed insulting,” she said gently, “but the idea seems
so singular&mdash;so preposterous! At the risk of offending
you again, Mr. Black, I must suggest that a union with
Mrs. Artress would be more suitable. I am only a girl,
and young still, as you know, and it is proper that youth
should mate with youth.”</p>

<p>“You prefer my son then?”</p>

<p>“To you? I do.”</p>

<p>“And you will marry him?”</p>

<p>The lovely face shadowed, but Neva answered
quietly:</p>

<p>“Mr. Rufus has asked me that question, sir, and I
prefer to have him receive his answer from my lips.
Whatever my feelings toward him, I have no indecision
in regard to you.”</p>

<p>“And you actually and decidedly refuse me?”</p>

<p>“Actually and decidedly, Mr. Black!”</p>

<p>“Is there no hope that you may change your mind
Miss Wynde? Will no devotion upon my part affect
your resolution?”</p>

<p>“None whatever. I cannot even give your proposal
serious consideration, Mr. Black. I am willing to regard
you as a friend. As a lover, pardon me, you would be
intolerable to me.”</p>

<p>Neva spoke with an honest frankness that increased
Craven Black’s anger. He saw that he had no chance
of winning her love or her fortune, and it behooved him
not to lose the lesser fortune and lesser charms of her
step-mother. He tried to take his failure philosophically,
but in refusing his love, Neva had made him her
bitter and unscrupulous enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>“I accept my defeat, Miss Wynde,” he said bitterly,
“and resign all my pretensions to your hand. Pardon
my folly, and forget it. I hope my son will meet with
better success in his suit. And may I ask as a favor that
you will keep my proposal secret, not even telling it to
your step-mother?”</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of boasting of such things,
even to Lady Wynde,” said Neva, coldly. “Your proposal,
Mr. Black, is already forgotten.”</p>

<p>They were in Dingle wood now, and the heiress struck
her horse sharply and dashed away at a canter. Craven
Black kept pace with her, and at a discreet distance
behind followed the liveried groom.</p>

<p>Neither spoke again until they were out of the wood,
and had traversed the cross-road and gained the highway.
When the gray towers of Hawkhurst loomed up
in full view, their speed slackened, and Craven Black
said hastily:</p>

<p>“One word, Miss Wynde. I have your solemn promise,
have I not, that you will never betray the fact that
I have proposed marriage to you?”</p>

<p>Neva bowed haughtily.</p>

<p>“Since you have not confidence in my delicacy,” she
said, “I will give the promise.”</p>

<p>Craven Black’s face flushed with something of triumph.
He was still smarting with his anger and disappointment,
still secretly foaming with a bitter rage, but
he desired to show Neva that he was not at all crushed
or humiliated.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “I shall rely upon that promise.
The truth is, Miss Neva, a betrayal of my secret
would cause me serious trouble. Ladies never pardon
even a slight and temporary disaffection like mine. I
am engaged to be married, and my promised bride is the
most exacting of women. She would rage if she knew<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
that I had looked with love upon one so many years
her junior.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! You will marry Artress then?”</p>

<p>“Artress?” ejaculated Black, in well-counterfeited
amazement. “What, marry the companion when I can
have the mistress? No, indeed, Miss Neva. I am engaged
to Lady Wynde!”</p>

<p>“To Lady Wynde&mdash;to my father’s widow?”</p>

<p>Black bowed assent.</p>

<p>Neva was astounded. She had been too busy with
her friends since her return to Hawkhurst to detect the
real object of Craven Black’s visits, and both Lady
Wynde and Black had conspired to hoodwink her. She
had never contemplated the possibility of Lady Wynde
marrying for the third time. The idea almost seemed
sacrilegious. Her father had seemed to her so grand
and noble, so above other men, that she had not deemed
it possible for a woman who had once been honored
with his love to marry another.</p>

<p>“It is like Marie Louise, who married her chamberlain
after having been the wife of Napoleon,” she
thought. “It is incredible. I refuse to believe it!”</p>

<p>Her incredulity betrayed itself in her face.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe it?” said Black, with a mocking
smile. “It is true, I assure you. Lady Wynde and I
became engaged before your return from school. We
are to be married next month. Her trousseau is secretly
preparing in London.”</p>

<p>His manner convinced Neva that he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>“And so,” she said, her lip curling, “when your wedding-day
is so near, and the woman you have won is
making ready for your marriage, you amuse yourself in
talking love to me! And that is your idea of honor,
Mr. Black? You are well named. Craven by name, and
Craven by nature!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>She inclined her head haughtily and dashed on. Black,
choking with rage, hurried in close pursuit. The lodge
gates swung open at their approach, and they galloped
up the avenue. Lady Wynde came out upon the terrace
to meet them. Neva dismounted at the carriage porch,
the terrace being only upon one side of the mansion, and
with a haughty little bow to Lady Wynde passed into
the house.</p>

<p>Black dismounted and gave his horse in charge of the
stable lad who had taken in hand the horse of Neva,
and then walked toward the open drawing-room window
with his betrothed wife.</p>

<p>“What is the matter between you and Neva, Craven?”
asked Lady Wynde jealously. “You look as black as a
thundercloud, and she looked like an insulted queen.
What have you been saying to her?”</p>

<p>“I thought it time to divulge our secret to her, my
darling,” said Black hypocritically. “Our wedding-day
is so near that I deemed it best to inform her. I met her
out riding, and seized upon the occasion to declare the
truth.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p>“She fairly withered me with her scorn; recommended
me to marry Matilda Artress; and seemed to regard my
marriage with her father’s widow as a species of sacrilege.
I hate her!” he hissed between his clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde smiled, well-pleased.</p>

<p>“And so do I,” she acknowledged frankly. “But it
is for our interest to counterfeit friendship for her. Be
patient, Craven. Some day you and I may bring down
her haughty pride to the dust.”</p>

<p>“Suppose she refuses Rufus?”</p>

<p>“You and I will soon be married, Craven, and in our
union is strength. Tell Rufus to write to Neva, delaying<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
her answer to his suit for a month. By that time we shall
be married. If she refuses then to accept your son as her
husband, we can contrive some way to compel her
obedience. I am her step-mother and guardian, and
have authority which I shall use if I am pushed to the
wall. I promise you, Craven, that we shall secure our
ten thousand a year out of Neva’s fortune, and that we
shall compel the girl to marry your son. Leave it all to
me. Only wait and see!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA’S CHOICE FORESHADOWED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In accordance with the advice of his scheming father,
Rufus Black wrote a letter to Neva Wynde entreating
her to take a month or six weeks, instead of the single
week for which she had stipulated, for the consideration
of his suit. And Neva, struggling between conflicting
feelings, whose nature the reader already knows, and
glad to be relieved of the necessity for an immediate
decision, gratefully accepted the offered reprieve.</p>

<p>The engagement of Craven Black and Lady Wynde,
now that it had been declared to Neva, was no longer
kept a secret from the world. Mr. Black, in a moment
of good-natured condescension, informed his host at the
Wyndham inn, and the amazed landlord bruited the
story through the village. The engagement was publicly
announced in the court papers, Craven Black himself
writing the paragraph and procuring its insertion,
and this announcement was copied into the Kentish
journals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>As may be imagined, the news of Lady Wynde’s intended
marriage produced quite a sensation in the neighborhood
of Hawkhurst. Sir Harold Wynde’s former
friends were scandalized that he should have been so
soon forgotten by the wife he had idolized, and that a
man so palpably inferior to the baronet in character and
attributes should have been chosen to take his place.
Others, the three guardians of Neva’s property among
the number, were ill-pleased that Craven Black should
take his place during Neva’s minority as nominal master
of Hawkhurst, and accordingly one morning, a fortnight
after the publication of the engagement, Sir John Freise,
Mr. Atkins, and Lord Towyn, rode over to Hawkhurst,
and demanded an interview with Lady Wynde and
Neva.</p>

<p>Miss Wynde appeared first in the drawing-room, simply
dressed in white, and fresh from a ramble in the park.
She looked a little worn and troubled, as if her nights
were spent more in anxious thoughts than in slumbers,
but the radiance of her wonderful red-brown eyes was
undimmed, and her face had lost nothing of the piquant
witchery which was its chiefest charm.</p>

<p>Before time had been granted Neva to more than
exchange greetings with her guardians, Lady Wynde
entered the room with an indolent languor of motion,
and welcomed her visitors with effusion.</p>

<p>“This is an unexpected pleasure, gentlemen,” said her
ladyship, her black eyes glancing from one to another.
“You have come to congratulate me upon the change in
my prospects, I dare say. I have been overwhelmed
with calls during the past week, and begin to find my
connection with an old county family decidedly onerous,”
and she laughed softly. “All of Sir Harold’s
friends have been to see me, and really I believe that
some of them have felt it their duty to condole with<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
Neva upon the misfortune of so soon possessing a step-papa.”</p>

<p>The three gentlemen had called for the purpose of
discussing with Lady Wynde and Neva the expected
change in the prospects of her ladyship, but the quiet
audacity of the handsome widow’s speech and manner
half-confounded them.</p>

<p>Sir John Freise, being the eldest of the party, took
upon himself the office of spokesman.</p>

<p>“I was an old friend of Sir Harold, Lady Wynde,” he
said, a little stiffly. “I was a man when Sir Harold was
a boy, but I knew him well, and I loved him. I know
how deeply he was attached to you, and it is for his sake
that I have now intruded upon you. You are still young,
and with your attractions and your fortune you are peculiarly
liable to be beset by fortune-hunters. As your
late husband’s most intimate friend, I desire to ask you
if you have well considered this step you are about to
take?”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde bowed a cold assent.</p>

<p>“Your knowledge of the character of Mr. Black can
be but slight,” persisted Sir John Freise, leaning his
chin upon the gold knob of his walking-stick, and regarding
the handsome widow with troubled eyes. “He
has been at Wyndham but a few months. I grant that
he is of attractive exterior, Lady Wynde, but what do
you know of his character? I have not come here to
make any charges against Mr. Black but those I am prepared
to substantiate. These gentlemen who have accompanied
me will bear me out in the statement that I
have no personal prejudices in the matter, and that I am
actuated only by a desire for your ladyship’s happiness
and that of Miss Wynde. I have written to London
since hearing the report of your engagement, and yesterday
received a reply of so much moment that I summoned<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
Lord Towyn from his marine villa and Mr. Atkins
from Canterbury to accompany me into your presence,
and assist me to impart to you the unpleasant
news. Lady Wynde, this Craven Black, your accepted
lover, is a scoundrel, a gamester, a man unworthy your
consideration for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Lady Wynde, with a slight sneer.
“Mr. Black, to my knowledge, goes in the first society.
He visited at the Duke of Cheltenham’s last year, and
the duke is a perfect Puritan, as every one knows.”</p>

<p>“The Duke of Cheltenham is a distant connection of
Mr. Black, and invited him to his house with the hope
of winning him into better courses,” said Sir John
gravely. “But it is not Mr. Black’s high connections,
but the man himself, with whom your destiny is to be
linked, Lady Wynde. I implore you to consider your
decision. Better to remain for ever the honored widow
of Sir Harold Wynde than to become the wife of Mr.
Craven Black.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” said her ladyship, her sneer deepening.
“I believe I am competent to choose for myself,
Sir John, and it is <em>my</em> happiness, you will be pleased to
remember, which is at stake. I resent your interference,
as uncalled for and intrusive. I shall marry Mr. Craven
Black in two weeks from to-day, and if you do not
approve the marriage I presume you will be able to
testify your disapproval by remaining away from the
wedding.”</p>

<p>Sir John looked deeply pained; Mr. Atkins looked
disgusted. Lord Towyn’s warm blue eyes were directed
toward Neva rather than toward Lady Wynde, but he
lost nothing of the conversation.</p>

<p>“I have performed only my duty in warning you,
Lady Wynde,” said Sir John, after a pause. “You are
bent upon this marriage with a man who was a stranger<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
to you three months since, and so soon after the tragic
death of Sir Harold Wynde in India?”</p>

<p>“I have waited a year and three months before marrying
again,” declared Lady Wynde, impatiently. “Why
should I wait longer? Surely a year of mourning is all
that custom requires. And as to not knowing Mr. Black,
permit me to say that I know him well. I knew him
before I ever met Sir Harold. Frequenting the same
circles in town, and meeting more than once at the same
houses in the country, it is impossible that I should not
have known him. And here I beg you will drop the
subject. I am in no mood to hear your aspersions of an
honorable man, and your jealousy for the memory of
Sir Harold Wynde need not blind you to the fact that
virtue and honor did not die with him.”</p>

<p>Sir John looked shocked and amazed. Neva’s face
paled, and a sudden indignation flamed in her eyes, but
she remained silent.</p>

<p>“I think, with all deference to your opinion, Sir John,”
said Mr. Atkins, “that, as Lady Wynde suggests, we
would better drop the subject of Mr. Black. It is difficult
to convey unpleasant information in a case like this without
giving offence. We have done our duty, and that
must content us. Let us now come to the actual business
in hand. Allow me to ask you, Lady Wynde, if you
intend to continue your residence at Hawkhurst after
becoming Mrs. Craven Black?”</p>

<p>A flash of defiance shot from her ladyship’s black
eyes.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I intend to reside here with my husband
during the minority of my step-daughter,” she declared
boldly. “I am Neva’s guardian, and my residence as
such was assigned at Hawkhurst.”</p>

<p>“Sir Harold never contemplated a state of affairs such
as you propose Madam,” said Mr. Atkins doggedly.<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
“To make this Mr. Craven Black nominal master of
the home of the Wyndes is something utterly unlooked
for.”</p>

<p>“Where I am mistress, my husband will be master!”
asserted Lady Wynde, with temper.</p>

<p>“It should be so,” declared Mr. Atkins, “but you see
how inappropriate it would be to make Mr. Black master
of Hawkhurst. Good taste&mdash;pardon my plainness&mdash;would
dictate your ladyship’s retirement from Hawkhurst
upon the occasion of your third marriage, and we
have come to propose that Hawkhurst be closed, Miss
Neva transferred to the guardianship of Sir John Freise
and Lady Freise, and that you and your new husband
take up your abode at Wynde Heights, your dower house,
or at any other place you may prefer.”</p>

<p>Lady Wynde frowned her anger and defiance.</p>

<p>“I shall remain at Hawkhurst,” she exclaimed haughtily.
“If you desire to remove me, you must do so by
process of law. If you think her father’s wife an unfit
personal guardian for Miss Wynde, you can have Sir
Harold’s will set aside, or take legal proceedings to obtain
for her another guardian. I shall not relinquish my
post, or the charge my dead husband reposed in me, until
I am compelled to do so.”</p>

<p>The young Lord Towyn’s face flushed, and he addressed
Neva, in his clear ringing voice:</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde, this matter concerns you above all
others, and it is for you to have a voice in it. The proposed
marriage of Lady Wynde completely vitiates your
present relations to her. In becoming Mrs. Craven Black,
I consider that Lady Wynde throws off all allegiance to
Sir Harold Wynde, and ceases to be your step-mother.
It is for you to decide if you will choose a new personal
guardian in her stead.”</p>

<p>All eyes turned upon the fair young girl. The young<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
earl awaited her reply with a breathless anxiety. Sir John
Freise and Mr. Atkins fixed their eager gaze upon her,
and Lady Wynde regarded her sharply and with some
uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Before Neva comes to a decision,” said her ladyship
hastily, “I have a word to say to her. Have I not treated
you with all kindness and tenderness, Neva, since you
came under this roof? Have I been guilty of one act of
neglect, of step-motherly cruelty, or want of consideration?
Have not your wishes been considered in all
things?”</p>

<p>Neva could not answer these questions in the negative.</p>

<p>“There is no stipulation in Sir Harold’s will that I
should not again marry,” continued Lady Wynde. “Sir
Harold, without mention of the contingency of another
marriage on my part, constituted me his daughter’s personal
guardian, with the request that I make Hawkhurst
my home until Neva marries or attains her majority. Not
one word is said about or against my marriage, you will
observe; and certainly Sir Harold Wynde was too sensible
to expect me to remain a widow long&mdash;at my age
too. My marriage, therefore, does not interfere with my
relations toward Neva as her step-mother and personal
guardian. Any court of law will confirm this decision.
If you choose, Neva, to apply for a change of guardians,
and to make a scandal, and to make your name common
on every lip, I can only regret your ill-taste, and that you
have yielded to such ill-guidance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins felt a sentiment of admiration mingle with
his dislike for Lady Wynde.</p>

<p>“She ought to have been a lawyer,” he thought. “She’s
a mighty sharp woman, and we are sure to get the worst
of it in a battle with her. Pity we made the attack, if it
is only to put her on her guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>Neva was still considering the matter intently. She
had a thorough contempt for Craven Black, and disliked
the prospect of being under the same roof with him, but
she dreaded still more the publicity that would be given
to her application for change of guardians. She remembered
her father’s many injunctions to cling to Lady
Wynde until her own marriage, or the attainment of her
majority. Lady Wynde had not been unkind to her, nor
illy fulfilled her duties as chaperon. Neva had actually
nothing of which to complain, save Lady Wynde’s proposed
marriage. She was a conscientious girl, and she
could not decide to throw off the yoke her father had
placed upon her shoulders, simply because Lady Wynde
had chosen to enter into new relations which were not
likely to affect the old. She felt that she was placed in
a cruel position, but her duty, she thought, was plain to
her.</p>

<p>“Well, what is your decision, my child?” asked Sir
John Freise paternally.</p>

<p>“You are very kind to me, Sir John, and you also,
Lord Towyn and Mr. Atkins,” said the young girl tremulously,
“and I cannot properly express my gratitude to
you for your concern for me. I appreciate all you have
said, all that you mean. I own that Lady Wynde’s intended
marriage is repugnant to me, and that I cannot
understand how her ladyship can take Mr. Craven Black
into papa’s place, but I have tried to reconcile myself to
the change. And I think,” added Neva, her tones gathering
firmness, and a brave look shining in her eyes of
red gloom, “that I have not sufficient excuse for appealing
to the law to give me a change of guardians. I shall
have little to do or say to Mr. Craven Black, and Hawkhurst
is large enough for us both. It was papa’s wish
that I should remain for a certain period under the care
of Lady Wynde, and I cannot forget that she was papa’s<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
wife, and that he loved her. And more,” concluded
Neva very gently, “if Lady Wynde is about to contract
an imprudent marriage, and if she is likely to know sorrow
because of her false step, she will need my friendship
when the truth comes home to her. I thank you
again, Sir John, Lord Towyn, Mr. Atkins, but I do not
think I should be justified in taking the decided step
you advise.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you are right, Neva,” said Sir John.
“At any rate, give your ideas of duty a fair trial, and if
you change your mind let us know. It is not as if you
were going away from us. Mr. Black, finding himself in
a quiet, decorous neighborhood, may choose to settle
down, and become a better man. We shall see you frequently,
and my house will always be open to you, my
dear, and my wife and girls will always be glad to receive
you as an inmate of our family.”</p>

<p>“I shall not forget your kindness, Sir John,” said Neva
gratefully.</p>

<p>“Miss Neva has always a way of escape from an unpleasant
situation,” said the practical Mr. Atkins. “Her
marriage will free her from Lady Wynde’s guardianship
without publicity of an unpleasant description.”</p>

<p>Neva reddened vividly.</p>

<p>The frankness with which the conversation had been
distinguished had considerably surprised the young earl.
No one seemed to require the use of diplomacy in making
plain an unpleasant meaning, and even Lady Wynde did
not seem offended at the utterance of home truths from
the lips of Mr. Atkins. It was an hour for plain-dealing,
which was freely indulged in.</p>

<p>The visitors, finding their errand fruitless, offered
Lady Wynde their best wishes for her future, and bade
her good-morning. At the door, Sir John Freise looked
back with a smile and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>“You look pale, Neva. Come down the avenue for a
walk. I have a message for you from the girls which I
forgot to deliver.”</p>

<p>Neva procured her hat, and followed Sir John out of
the house. The horses were in waiting, and Mr. Atkins
mounted. Sir John and Lord Towyn took their bridles
on their arms, and walked slowly down the long arched
avenue with the young heiress.</p>

<p>Lady Wynde watched them jealously from the window.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, my dear,” said the kindly baronet, “that
you have made a romantic decision to-day, but you must
decide in this matter for yourself. If you remain unmarried,
these Blacks will fairly riot at Hawkhurst for the
next three years. Craven Black will fill your father’s
house with dissolute company, and you will be brought
in contact with men whom your father would never have
allowed to cross his threshold.”</p>

<p>“Should such an event arise,” said Neva, her lovely
face growing resolute and stern, “I will then consider
your proposition, Sir John, to seek a change of guardians.
But I dread the publicity such a proceeding
would cause.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take into consideration Atkins’ idea
then?” demanded Sir John, smiling, yet earnest. “You
must marry some day, Neva; why not marry soon?
You have plenty of suitors. Only choose some one
worthy to stand in your father’s place, and you will be
happy. Your marriage will be the best way out of the
difficulty&mdash;the best and the easiest. It would be a great
load off my mind to see you happily married, my dear
child. Wait a moment, Atkins?” added the baronet,
raising his voice. “Why go so fast? I have a word to
say to you.”</p>

<p>The kindly old man hurried on to speak to his coadjutor,<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
leading his horse as he went, and Neva and Lord
Towyn were left to themselves&mdash;an opportunity specially
planned by Sir John, who regarded his manœuvres
as decidedly Machiavellian, and who consequently
plumed himself upon their success.</p>

<p>The young earl’s visit at Freise Hall had long since
terminated, and he was now stopping at his marine villa
on the coast, a dozen miles or more away. The distance
was not so great that he could not ride over to Hawkhurst
every pleasant day, and he did so with an utter
disregard of distance or exertion. His suit with Neva,
however, had never progressed beyond his early declaration
of love, Neva’s reserve having chilled him whenever
he had attempted to renew the subject.</p>

<p>He recognized his present favorable opportunity, and
hastened to improve it.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we took you by storm to-day, Neva,”
said the young earl, as they slowly walked down the
avenue, considerably behind Mr. Atkins and Sir John,
who had now mounted. “But Sir John Freise was determined
to make an effort to save Lady Wynde from a
union which she is likely to regret. Her ladyship is too
pure and true to comprehend the character of her suitor,
and she will cling to him all the more determinedly because
of our well-meant warning.”</p>

<p>By this it will be seen that Lord Towyn, with his
frank nature, and honest soul, had not the slightest suspicion
of the real character of Lady Wynde. If Craven
Black was bad, she was also bad. She could never have
loved or been wholly at ease in the society of a good
man.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for her,” said Neva, sighing.</p>

<p>“She must ‘go her own gait,’” said Lord Towyn, “but
you must not be involved in her unhappiness. Neva,
darling Neva, I would almost die to spare you one pang<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
of sorrow, one shadow of grief. I love you, and each
day only adds to that love,” and his voice grew unsteady
and impassioned. “You have held me off at arms’ length
ever since that evening in which I told you so prematurely
how dear you were to me. Do not repulse me
now. Tell me honestly, my darling, whether you could
be happy with me&mdash;whether I am dearer to you than
another?”</p>

<p>His blue eyes, radiant with the warmth of his glowing
soul, flashed an electric light into hers. His passionate
face, so fair and handsome, so noble in expression
and feature, looked love upon hers. Neva’s eyelids
trembled and drooped. An answering thrill convulsed
her heart, and she knew in that moment that, come what
would, she loved Arthur Towyn with all her soul, even
as he loved her, and that she would know perfect happiness
only as his wife.</p>

<p>Yet the conviction came upon her as a painful shock,
and in that instant the struggle between her love and
her duty of obedience to the supposed wishes of her
dead father began in her heart.</p>

<p>“You love me?” whispered the young earl ardently,
and with a passionate tremor of his voice. “Neva, with
all my soul I love you, and I never loved before. Do I
love in vain?”</p>

<p>The shy, red-brown eyes were upraised for a brief
glance, but in their swift flash Lord Towyn read his
answer, and knew himself beloved.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence between them full of rapture.
They exchanged no betrothal kiss, no embrace, but Lord
Towyn held Neva’s hand in his, and in his fervent pressure
his soul spoke to hers.</p>

<p>“I may tell Sir John and Mr. Atkins that we are betrothed,
may I not, my darling?” said the young earl
softly, as they walked on yet more slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“Not yet, Arthur&mdash;not yet. I love you,” and the girl’s
voice sank to a whisper her lover’s ears could scarcely
catch, “but I want a little time to decide. Don’t look
surprised, Arthur; I do love you better than all the
world, but it is all so new and strange, and&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said the earl, his face beaming. “Our
love is too sacred to be proclaimed on the instant we
acknowledge it ourselves. We will keep it secret until
after Lady Wynde’s marriage; but we are promised,
darling! Our happiness would be complete if we could
know beyond all doubt that Sir Harold smiles upon our
union. And why should he not smile upon our marriage
from his home in Heaven? He loved me, Neva, and he
desired our marriage. My father told me this on his
death-bed.”</p>

<p>“If I could think so!” breathed Neva. “I know papa
loved you, Arthur. Do you think he would really
approve our marriage?”</p>

<p>“What an anxious little face! I know he would approve
it, Neva. My blessed little darling, mine own,
whom no one can take from me!” cried Lord Towyn
passionately. “I am going home to dine with Sir John,
and I will call upon you this evening. I am going to
exact a lover’s privilege of seeing you when I please,
without the cold, prying eyes of Mrs. Artress devouring
me. I will be prudent and secret, Neva, since you insist
upon it, but oh, if my month of probation were over
and I might proclaim my happiness to the world!”</p>

<p>They parted near the lodge gates, and Neva returned
slowly toward the house, while her young lover vaulted
into his saddle and rejoined his friends with a countenance
so rapturous that they could not avoid knowing
that he had confessed his love to Neva and had not been
rejected.</p>

<p>While they overwhelmed him with congratulations,<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
which he tried to disclaim as altogether premature,
Neva’s mind was divided between joy and grief, and she
murmured:</p>

<p>“What shall I do? What is right for me to do? I love
Arthur, and life will not be complete without him. Shall
I, for the sake of that love, disregard papa’s last wishes
which I vowed to accept as sacred commands? Oh, if I
only knew what to do!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WAS IT A DREAM?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the time appointed for the marriage of Lady
Wynde and Craven Black drew near, great preparations
were entered upon for its celebration. One would have
thought, from the scale of the arrangements on foot,
that the heiress of Hawkhurst was to be the bride,
rather than the baronet’s widow. Dress-makers came
down from London, boxes were sent to and fro, new
jewels from Emanuel’s or Ryder’s, were selected to replace
the Wynde family jewels, which Mr. Atkins had
compelled the handsome widow to yield up to her step-daughter,
and Artress made a special trip to Brussels
for laces, and to Paris for delicate and sumptuous novelties
in attire. One or two of Madame Elise’s best
work women spent several days at Hawkhurst in fitting
robes, and Lady Wynde, with Neva, Artress and two
maids, spent a week in London at the long-closed town
house of Sir Harold.</p>

<p>The eventful day came at last, and was one of the
mellowest of all that mellow October. The sun flooded<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
the little village of Wyndham in waves of golden light.
The pretty little stone church in which the marriage
ceremony was to be performed was beautifully decorated
with flowers. A floral arch vailed the door-way.
A carpet of red roses, from the glass-houses at Hawkhurst,
strewed the path the bride must traverse in going
from her carriage to the church door.</p>

<p>Inside the church, myrtles and red roses festooned the
walls, and were suspended above the spot where the
bride and groom would stand, in the form of a marriage
bell. The breath of roses filled the air with perfume
sweeter than “gales from Araby.”</p>

<p>Long before eleven o’clock, the villagers and the tenants
of Hawkhurst began to assemble at the church.
They were all in gala attire, for Lady Wynde, with an
insatiable vanity, had decreed that her third marriage-day
was to be a gala-day for the retainers of the Wynde
family. The villagers and tenants were all invited to a
grand out-door feast at Hawkhurst, where a hogshead
of ale, it was said, was to be broached, and deers and
pigs roasted whole. A brass band from Canterbury had
been engaged for the evening, and there would be colored
lanterns suspended from the trees, and dancing on
the terrace and on the lawn.</p>

<p>Soon after eleven, the carriages of various county
families began to arrive at the church. Sir John and
Lady Freise, with their seven blooming daughters whose
ages ranged from eighteen to thirty-five, were among
the first comers. One of the white-gloved ushers, with
a bridal favor pinned to his coat, showed them into
a reserved seat. Other acquaintances and friends, some
curious, some full of condemnation, made their appearance,
and were similarly accommodated. Lord Towyn
and Mr. Atkins came in together.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o’clock when two carriages rolled<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
up to the church door, bringing the bridal party from
Hawkhurst. From the first of these alighted Neva and
Rufus Black. The heiress was attired in white, with
pink ribbon at her waist and pink roses securing the
frill of lace at her throat, and Rufus wore the prescribed
dress suit of black. They walked up the aisle side by
side, and more than one noticed how pale the young
girl was. They took their places in the Wynde family
pew, for Neva had resolutely declined to enact the part
of bride’s-maid to her father’s widow, and would have
declined to appear at the wedding had not she realized
that her absence would be more marked and conspicuous
than her presence.</p>

<p>The young heiress had scarcely sank into her seat,
when a fluttering at the door declared to the assembly
that the hero and heroine of the occasion were at hand.
In defiance of the custom of meeting at the altar, Craven
Black and Lady Wynde came in together, she leaning
upon his arm.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was dressed in a pink moire, with sweeping
court train of pink velvet. She had worn white at
her first marriage, pearl color at her second; and for the
third, and most satisfactorily to her, had put on the
color of love. A diadem set with flashing diamonds
starred her black, fashionably dishevelled hair, above
her low forehead. Her arms and neck were bare, and
glittered with gems. Her face was flushed with
triumph; her black eyes shone with a perfect self-content.</p>

<p>The bridal pair took their places before the altar, and
the clergyman and his assistants began their office. The
usual questions were asked and answered; the usual appeal
made to any one who knew “any just cause or impediment
why these two should not be united,” but
which, of course, received no response; and her third<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
marriage ring was slipped upon Lady Wynde’s finger,
and for the third time she was a wife.</p>

<p>If any regret mingled with her present happiness, it
was that by her third marriage she lost the title her
second alliance had conferred upon her. But as there
was a prospect that Craven Black would inherit a title
some day, and that she would then be a peeress, she
easily contented herself with her present untitled condition.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, the newly married pair proceeded
to the vestry and signed the marriage register. Friends
and curious acquaintances thronged in upon them with
congratulations, and soon after, when the church bell
began peeling merrily, the bride and groom reentered
their carriage, and drove home to Hawkhurst.</p>

<p>Neva and Rufus Black followed in the second carriage.</p>

<p>The guests invited to the wedding breakfast entered
their carriages, and followed in the wake of the bridal
pair.</p>

<p>The villagers and tenants, in a great, straggling
crowd, proceeded on foot along the dusty road, to take
their part in the out-door festivities.</p>

<p>A magnificent green arch had been erected over the
great gates, with the monogram of the bride and groom
curiously intertwisted, and lettered in red roses upon the
green ground. Three similar arches intersected at regular
distances the long avenue. The marble terrace was
bordered with orange trees, oleanders, lemon-trees, and
tropical shrubs, all in wooden tubs, and the front porch
was a very bower of myrtles and red roses.</p>

<p>“It is all in singularly bad taste,” was Sir John
Freise’s exclamation, as he surveyed the scene. “It’s
very fine, girls, and would do very well if it was all for
Neva’s marriage, but it is worse than tomfoolery to invite<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
Sir Harold Wynde’s tenantry and friends to rejoice
at the wedding of Sir Harold’s widow to a man not
worthy to tie his shoes. I must repeat that it is in singularly
bad taste. The tenantry are not Lady Wynde’s;
the house is not Lady Wynde’s. What can be done to
give distinction to the marriage-day of the heiress, if all
this display is made for Lady Wynde?”</p>

<p>Sir John’s sentiment was the general one among the
house guests. Some were disgusted, and others privately
sneered, but there were some to whom the proceedings
of the baronet’s widow seemed eminently
proper, and these fawned upon her now.</p>

<p>The wedding breakfast was eaten in the grand old
dining-hall, among flowers which, by a rare refinement
of taste, had been chosen for this room without perfume.
The tables were resplendent with gold and silver plate.
Fruits of rare species and delicious flavor, fresh from
the hot-houses of Hawkhurst, were nestled among blossoms
or green leaves. A noted French cook from London
had charge of the commissary department, and
the rare old wines from Sir Harold’s cellar were unequalled.</p>

<p>While toasts were offered and drank to the newly
married pair in the banquet hall, the tenantry were
amusing themselves with their barbecue and ale out of
doors, and their hilarity corresponded to the lower-toned
merriment within the house.</p>

<p>After the breakfast, Sir John Freise and his family,
and several others, all of whom had come out of respect
to Neva rather than to compliment Lady Wynde, took
their departure. Many guests remained for the ball.
Lord Towyn took his leave toward evening, and Neva
retired to her own room, whence she did not emerge
again that night.</p>

<p>She had tried hard to dissuade Lady Wynde from<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
giving the ball, but her persuasions had not availed.
Neva had declined to attend the ball, and Lady Freise
had supported her in her refusal. How could she dance
in honor of the third marriage of her father’s widow?
All day her thoughts had been of India and of her father,
and remembering his tragical fate, how could she rejoice
at a union which could never have taken place but
for his death?</p>

<p>Her step-mother was angry at what she deemed
Neva’s obstinacy, and came to her and commanded her
to descend to the ball-room. The young girl was
sternly resolute in her refusal, and the bride went away
muttering her anger and annoyance, but powerless to
compel obedience.</p>

<p>There was dancing until a late hour that night in the
old baronial hall that traversed the centre of the great
mansion, and there was dancing outside upon the terrace
and lawn to the music of a brass band. Mrs. Craven
Black&mdash;Lady Wynde no longer&mdash;was the belle of the
occasion, full of gayety and brightness. Mrs. Artress,
to the amazement of everybody who had known her as
the gray companion of Lady Wynde, flashed forth in the
sudden splendor of jewels and a trained dress of crimson
silk, and Craven Black danced one set with her, and
saw her supplied with numerous partners. Mrs. Artress
considered that her day of servitude was over, and that
it was quite possible that she might make a “good
match” with some wealthy country gentleman, for
whom, during all the evening, she kept a diligent look-out.</p>

<p>Among the guests were two or three reporters of
society papers from London, whom Craven Black, with
an eye to the publicity of his glory, had invited down to
Hawkhurst. These gentlemen danced and supped and
wined, and in the pauses of these exercises wrote down<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
glowing descriptions of the festivities, elaborate details
of the ladies’ dresses, and ecstatic little eulogies of the
bride’s beauty and connection with the Wynde family,
and of the groom’s pedigree, stating the precise value of
Craven Black’s prospects of a succession to his cousin,
Viscount Torrimore.</p>

<p>The aunt of the bride, Mrs. Hyde of Bloomsbury
Square, was not present. She lay indeed at the point
of death, a fact which Mrs. Craven Black judiciously
confined to her own breast, the news having reached her
that morning as she was dressing for her bridal.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, midnight, fire-works were displayed
on the lawn. They lasted over half an hour, and were
very creditable. After they had finished, carriages were
ordered, and the house guests departed in a steady
stream until all were gone. The tenantry and villagers
departed to their homes on foot or in wagons, as they
had come. The colored lanterns were taken down from
the trees; the musicians went away, and the lights one
by one died out of the great mansion.</p>

<p>The bridal pair were to remain a week at Hawkhurst,
and were then to go to Wynde Heights, the dower
house of the baronet’s widow, and it had been arranged
that Neva should accompany her step-mother. Rufus
Black was to be a member of the party also, and much
was hoped by Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black from the
enforced propinquity of the young couple.</p>

<p>Silence succeeded to the late noise, confusion and
merriment&mdash;a silence the more profound by contrast
with what had preceded. The household had retired.
Neva had long since dismissed her maid and gone to
bed, thinking sadly of her father. Even before the last
carriage had rolled away, Neva had fallen asleep, not-withstanding
her wrapt musings concerning her father,
and as the hours went on, and darkness and silence fell,<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
that sleep had deepened into a strange and almost
breathless slumber.</p>

<p>But suddenly she sprang up, broad awake, her eyes
starting, a cold dew on her forehead, a wild cry upon
her lips.</p>

<p>She stared around her with a look of terror. The
white curtains of her bed were fluttering in the breeze
from her open window, and around her lay the thick
gloom of her chamber.</p>

<p>Her voice called through the darkness in a wild, piercing
wail:</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, papa! I dreamed&mdash;ah, was it a dream?&mdash;that
he still lives! I saw him, pale and ghastly, at the
door of a hut among the Indian hills, and I heard his
voice calling the names: ‘Octavia! Neva!’ He is not
dead&mdash;he is not dead! So surely as I live, I believe that
papa too is alive! Oh, my father, my father!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SCENE IN INDIA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Neva Wynde had retired to her bed, as will be remembered,
upon the marriage night of Lady Wynde and
Craven Black, her thoughts all of her father and of his
tragic fate in India. All day long she had thought of him
with tender yearning, pity and regret, recalling to mind
his goodness, nobleness, and grandeur of soul; and when
night came, and she lay in her bed with the noise of
revellers in the drawing-rooms and on the lawn coming
faintly to her ears, she had sobbed aloud at the thought
that her father had been so soon forgotten, and that his<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
friends and tenantry were now making merry over the
marriage of his widow to a man unworthy to cross the
threshold of Hawkhurst.</p>

<p>And thus sobbing and thinking, she had slept, and in
her sleep had dreamed that her father still lived, and
that she saw him standing at the door of a hut among
the far-off Indian hills, and that she heard his voice calling
“Octavia! Neva!” And thus dreaming, she had
awakened with a cry of terror, to ask of herself if it was
only a dream.</p>

<p>It was not strange that she had thus dreamed, since
all the day and all the evening her mind had been fixed
upon her father. It would have been strange if she had
not dreamed of him. Her dream had had the clearness
of a vision, but Neva was not romantic, and although
she slept no more that night, but walked her floor with
noiseless steps and wildly questioning eyes, yet she convinced
herself long before the morning that she had been
the victim of her excited imagination, and that her
dream was “only a dream.”</p>

<p>But was it so? There is a philosophy in dreams
which not the wisest of us can fathom. And although
the cause of Neva’s dream can be simply and naturally
explained as the result of her agitated thoughts of her
father, yet might one not also think, with less of this
world’s wisdom, perhaps, and more of tenderness, that
the girl’s guardian angel had placed that picture before
her in her sleep, and so made recompense, in the joy of
her dream, for her day of anguish and unrest?</p>

<p>Be this as it may, our story has to deal with actual
facts, and has now to take a startling turn, perhaps not
anticipated by the reader.</p>

<p>It was about one o’clock of the morning when Neva
awakened from her dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>It was then about seven o’clock&mdash;there being six hours
difference in time&mdash;in India.</p>

<p>Among the cool shadows of the glorious Himalayas
are many country seats, or “bungalows,” occupied at
certain seasons by exhausted English merchants from
Calcutta, with their families, by army officers, and by
others of foreign birth, enervated or rendered sickly
by the scorching heats of the sea-coast or more level
regions. They find “among the hills” the fresh air,
and consequent health, for which otherwise they would
have to undertake, at all inconvenience and expense, a
voyage home to England or Holland.</p>

<p>These bungalows, for the most part, are cheaply built
of bamboo, with thatched roofs, and are encircled with
broad and shaded verandas, always roofed, and sometimes
latticed at the sides and grown with vines, to form
a cool and leafy arcade, which serves all the purposes of
promenade, sitting-room, music-room, dining-room, and
even sleeping room, for there are usually bamboo
couches scattered about, upon which the indolent resident
takes his siesta at midday.</p>

<p>To one of these bungalows, a fair type of the rest, we
will now direct the attention of the reader.</p>

<p>It stood upon an elevated plateau, with the tall mountains
crested with snow in the distance. It was surrounded
at the distance of a few miles by a range of
hills, and between it and them lay miles of forest, which
was an impenetrable jungle. Around the bungalow was
a clearing of limited extent, and which was dotted with
plumed palms, bamboo, and banyan trees.</p>

<p>The dwelling, frail like all of its class, was sufficiently
well built for the climate. It was constructed of bamboo,
was a single story in height, and was thatched with
the broad leaves of the palm. A veranda, twelve feet
wide, surrounded it. Its interior consisted of a broad<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
hall, extending from front to rear, with two rooms opening
from each side of it. The central hall, containing no
staircase, was a long and wide apartment, which served
as dining-room, sitting-room, and parlor, when required.</p>

<p>A little in the rear of this dwelling were two others,
one of which served as the kitchen of the establishment,
and the other as the quarters of the half-dozen native
servants belonging to the place.</p>

<p>The bungalow which we have thus briefly described
belonged to a Major Archer, H. M. A., and it was under
its roof that George Wynde had breathed his last.
It was from its broad veranda that Sir Harold Wynde
had rode away for a last morning ride in India, upon
that fatal day on which he had encountered the tiger
of the jungle, in which encounter he was said to have
perished.</p>

<p>At about seven o’clock of the morning then, as we
have said, and about the moment when Neva awakened
from her dream, Major Archer reclined lazily upon a
bamboo couch in the shadow of his veranda. He was
dressed in a suit of white linen, and wore a broad-brimmed
straw-hat, which was tipped carelessly upon
the back part of his head. He was reading an English
paper, received that morning at the hands of his messenger,
and indolently smoking a cigar as he read.</p>

<p>The major was a short, stout, choleric man, with a
warm heart and a ready tongue. He had greatly loved
young Captain Wynde, and still mourned his death, and
he mourned also the tragic fate of Sir Harold.</p>

<p>“Not much news by this mail,” the major muttered,
as he withdrew his cigar and emitted a cloud of smoke
from his pursed lips.</p>

<p>“And no hope whatever of our regiment being ordered
back to England! We shall get gray out here in this
heathenish climate, while the fancy regiments play the<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
heroes at balls in country towns at home. The good
things of life are pretty unevenly distributed any how.”</p>

<p>He replaced his cigar and clapped his hands sonorously.
A light-footed native, clad in loose white trousers and
white turban, and having his copper-colored waist naked,
glided around an angle of the veranda and approached
him with a salaam.</p>

<p>“Sherbet,” said the major sententiously.</p>

<p>The servant muttering, “Yes, Sahib,” glided away as
he had come.</p>

<p>The major let fall his paper and reclined his head
upon a bamboo rest, continuing to smoke. He had
arisen hours before, had taken his usual morning ride to
the house of a friend, his nearest neighbor, three miles
distant, and had returned to breakfast with his wife and
family, who were now occupied in one of the four rooms
of the dwelling. The major’s duties for the day were
now to be suspended until sunset, the intervening hours
being spent in smoking, reading, sleeping and partaking
frequently of light and cooling refreshments.</p>

<p>The sherbet was presently brought to the major in a
crystal jug upon a salver. He laid down his cigar and
sipped the beverage with an air of enjoyment, yet lazily,
as he did everything.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I should get along without you,
Karrah,” said the major. “And you know it too, you
dog. I pay you big wages as it is, and now I want to
know how much extra you will take, and forego your
present practice of stealing. I think I’d better commute.
Mrs. Archer says you are robbing us right and left.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>The native, a slim, lithe, sinewy fellow with oblong
black eyes, full of slyness and wickedness, a mouth indicative
of a cruel disposition, and with movements like a
cat, grinned at the major’s speech, but did not deny the<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
charge. He had formerly been George Wynde’s servant
and nurse, then Sir Harold’s attendant, and was now
Major Archer’s most valued servant. He had made himself
necessary to the officer by his knowledge of all his
master’s requirements, and his exact fulfillment of them;
by his skill in concocting sherbets and other cooling
drinks; by his apparent devotion, and in other ways.
Being so highly valued, he had every opportunity, in
that loosely ordered household, of robbing his employer,
and he was maintaining a steady drain upon the major’s
purse which that officer now purposed to abolish.</p>

<p>“Come, you coppery rascal,” said the major good-humoredly,
“what will you take to let the sugar and
tea and coffee and the rest of the things alone, except
when you find them on the table?”</p>

<p>“Karrah no make bargain, Sahib,” said the native,
rolling up his eyes. “Karrah do better as it is.”</p>

<p>“No doubt; but I’m afraid, my worthy copper, that
we shall have to part unless you and I can commute
your stealings. Yesterday, for instance, I left five gold
sovereigns in my other coat pocket, and last night when
I happened to think of them and look for them they
were gone. You took them&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No prove, Sahib&mdash;no prove!” said the native stolidly.</p>

<p>“I can prove that no one but you went into that room
yesterday except me,” declared the major coolly. “You
needn’t deny the theft, even if you purpose taking that
trouble. I know you took the money. You are a thief,
Karrah,” continued his master placidly and indolently,
“and a liar, Karrah, and a scoundrel, Karrah; but your
race is all tarred with the same stick, and I might as
well have you as another. By the way my fine Buddhist,
if that is what you are, did you use to steal right
and left from Captain Wynde?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>“Karrah honest man; Karrah no steal, but Karrah
always same.”</p>

<p>“Always the same! Poor George! Poor fellow!
No wonder he died!” muttered the major compassionately.
“It was a consumption of the lungs by disease,
and a consumption of means by a scoundrel. And did you
take in Sir Harold in the same way?”</p>

<p>The Hindoo’s face darkened, and an odd gleam shone
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold no ’count gen’leman,” he said briefly.
“Karrah no like him. Three days ’fore tiger eat him,
Karrah look into Sir Harold’s purse and take out gold,
only few miserable pieces, and Karrah look into Captain
Wynde’s trunk and take a few letters and diamond pin.
Sir Harold come in sudden, see it all; he eyes fire up;
he seize Karrah by waistband and kick he out doors.
Karrah hate Sir Harold&mdash;<em>hate&mdash;hate</em>!”</p>

<p>The indolent officer shrank before the sudden blaze of
his servant’s eyes, with a sudden realization of the possibilities
of that ignorant, untaught and vicious nature.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re a perfect demon, Karrah,” exclaimed
the major. “You’re a firebrand&mdash;a&mdash;a devil! If you
hated Sir Harold to such an extent, how did it happen
that you continued in his service, and were even his attendant
upon that last ride?”</p>

<p>The Hindoo smiled slowly, a strange, cruel smile.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said softly, “Karrah go back; Karrah say
sorry; know no better. Sir Harold smile sad, say been
hasty, and forgive. Karrah say he love Sir Harold.
That night Karrah send messenger up country&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused abruptly, as if he had said more than he
intended.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you send a messenger up country for,
you rascal?”</p>

<p>“To Karrah’s people, many miles away, to say that<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
Karrah not come home,” declared the Hindoo more
guardedly. “Makes no difference why Karrah sent.
Karrah stay with Sahib Sir Harold three days, and see
him die. Then Karrah live with Sahib Major.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t hate me,” said the major, with a
shudder. “I have a fancy that your hatred would be as
deadly as a cobra’s. If it were not for the tiger, I might
think&mdash;But, pshaw! And yet&mdash;I say, Karrah, did you
know that there was a tiger in that part of the jungle
that morning?”</p>

<p>“Karrah know nothing,” returned the Hindoo. “Karrah
good fellow. He has enemies&mdash;they happen die,
that’s all. Karrah no set a tiger on Sahib. Karrah no
friend tigers. Sahib have more sherbet?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing more. You may go, Karrah.”</p>

<p>The Hindoo glided away around the angle of the veranda.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll have to let the fellow go,” muttered the
major, uneasily. “His looks and words give me a
strangely unpleasant sensation. I shall take care not to
offend him, or he may season my sherbet with a snake’s
venom. How he glared in that one unguarded moment
when he said he hated Sir Harold! There was murder
in his look. I declare I had a hundred little shivers
down my spine. If Sir Harold had not been killed so
unmistakably by a tiger, and if Doctor Graham and I
had not seen the fresh tracks and the marks of the
struggle, and if the tiger had not been afterward killed, I
should think&mdash;I should be sure&mdash;”</p>

<p>An anxious look gathered on his face, and he ended
his sentence by a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>“Strange!” he said presently, giving utterance to his
secret thoughts; “my wife never liked this fellow, although
I could see no difference between him and the
rest. She insists that he is treacherous and cruel. <a id="Ref_216" href="#BRef_216">I’ll</a><span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
dismiss him, and tell her that I do so out of deference
to her judgment. But the truth is, since I’ve seen the
fellow’s soul glaring out of his eyes, I sha’n’t dare to
sleep nights for fear I may have offended his High Mightiness.
I think it better for me that he should travel out
of this.”</p>

<p>He had just announced to himself this decision, when
raising his eyes carelessly and looking out from the cool
shadows of the pleasant veranda, he beheld a horseman
approaching his bungalow, riding at great speed.</p>

<p>“It may be Doctor Graham coming up for a month,
as I invited him,” thought the major, too indolent to feel
more than a trivial curiosity at the sight of a coming
stranger. “But the doctor’s too sensible to ride like
that. It is either a green Englishman, with orders from
headquarters for me, or it’s some reckless native. In
either case the fellow’s preparing for a first-class sunstroke
or fever, or something of that nature. But that’s
his look-out. I’ve troubles enough of my own without
worrying about him. It might be as well to finish my
sherbet before losing my appetite under an order to return
to my post. Oh, bother the army!”</p>

<p>He sipped his sherbet leisurely, not even looking again
at the horseman, who came on swiftly, urging his horse
to a last burst of speed. That the horse was jaded, his
jerking, convulsive mode of going plainly showed. He
was wet with sweat, and his head hung low, and he frequently
stumbled. The horseman urged him on with
spur and whip, now and then looking behind him as if
he feared pursuit.</p>

<p>The major did not look up until the horseman drew
rein before the bungalow, and alighted at a huge stone
which served as a horse-block. The stranger came slowly
and falteringly toward the veranda, and then the Sybaritic
major set down his empty cup and glanced at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>The glance became a fixed gaze, full of wildness and
affright.</p>

<p>The stranger slowly entered the shade of the veranda
and there halted, his features working, his form trembling.
He looked weary and travel-stained. His haggard eyes
spoke to the owner of the bungalow in a wild appeal.</p>

<p>With the peculiar movement of an automaton, the
major slowly arose to his feet and came forward, his face
white, his eyes dilating, a tremulous quiver on his lips.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, major?” asked the stranger
wearily.</p>

<p>“Great heaven!” cried the major, even his lips growing
white. “It is not a ghost! I am not dreaming!
Have the dead come to life? It is&mdash;<em>it is&mdash;Sir Harold
Wynde</em>!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BACK AS FROM THE DEAD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The stranger who stood upon the veranda of Major
Archer’s bungalow was tall and thin, with a haggard face,
worn and sharp of feature, and full of deeply cut lines,
such as a long-continued anguish never fails to graven
on the features. His weary eyes were deeply sunken
under his brows, and were outlined with dark circles.
His hair was streaked with gray, and his long ragged
beard was half gray also. His face was white like death,
and unutterably wan. His garments were torn, and hung
about his lank body in rags, save where they were ill-patched
with bits of rags and vegetable fibres.</p>

<p>Was Major Archer right? Could this haggard and
pitiable being be Sir Harold Wynde of Hawkhurst, one<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
of the richest baronets in England, who was supposed to
have perished in the clutches of a tiger?</p>

<p>It seemed incredible&mdash;impossible.</p>

<p>And yet when the heavy eyelids lifted from the thin
white cheeks, and looked upon the major, it was Sir
Harold’s soul that looked through them. They were the
keen blue eyes the major remembered so well, so capable
of sternness or of tenderness, so expressive of the grand
and noble soul, the pure and lofty character, which had
distinguished the baronet.</p>

<p>Yes, the stranger was Sir Harold Wynde&mdash;alive and
well!</p>

<p>“You know me then, Major?” he said. “I am not
changed, as I thought, beyond all recognition!”</p>

<p>He held out his hand. The major grasped it in a mixture
of bewilderment and amazement, and not without
a thrill of superstitious terror.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought you were dead, Sir Harold,” he stammered.
“We all thought so, Graham and all. We
thought you were killed by a tiger. I&mdash;I don’t know
what to make of this!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold let go the major’s hand and staggered to
the bamboo couch upon which he sank wearily.</p>

<p>“He’s not dead&mdash;but dying,” muttered the major.
“Lord bless my soul! What am I to do?”</p>

<p>He clapped his hands vigorously. A moment later
his Hindoo servant Karrah glided around upon the front
veranda.</p>

<p>“Bring brandy&mdash;sherbet&mdash;anything!” gasped the
major, pointing at his guest. “He’s fainting, Karrah&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sir Harold lifted his weary head and gazed upon the
Hindoo. The sight seemed to endue him with new life.
He leaped to his feet, and his blue eyes blazed with an
awful lightning, as he pointed one long and bony finger
at the native, and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>“Traitor! Viper! Arrest him, Major. I accuse
him&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Hindoo stood for a second appalled, but as the
last words struck his hearing he flung at the baronet a
glance of deadly hatred, and then turned in silence and
fled from the bungalow, making toward the jungle.</p>

<p>Something of the truth flashed upon the major’s mind.
He routed up his household in a moment, and dispatched
them in pursuit of the fugitive.</p>

<p>Aroused by the tumult, Mrs. Archer came forth from
her chamber. She was a portly woman, and was dressed
in a light print, and wore a cap. Her husband met her
in the hall and told her what had occurred. Restraining
her curiosity, she hastened to prepare food and drink
for the returned baronet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Harold had sank down again upon the
couch. The major approached him, and said:</p>

<p>“You look worn out, Sir Harold. Let me show you
to a room, where I will attend upon you. My men will
capture that scoundrel&mdash;never fear. Come with me.”</p>

<p>The baronet arose and took the major’s arm and was
led into the central hall of the house, and into one of
the four rooms the house contained. It was the room
in which his son had died. The windows were closely
shuttered, but admitted the air at the top. The floor
was of wood and bare. A bedstead, couch, and chairs
of bamboo comprised the furniture.</p>

<p>At one side of the room were two spacious closets.
One of these contained a portable bath-tub, a rack of
fresh white towels, and plenty of water. The other contained
clothes depending from hooks.</p>

<p>“You’ll find your own suit of clothes there, Sir Harold,”
said the major. “I intended to send them to
England, but I am as fond of procrastination as ever.<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
It’s just as well though, now. You can take them home
yourself.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold sat down in the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Home!” he whispered. “How are they&mdash;Octavia?
Neva?”</p>

<p>“All well&mdash;or they were when I heard last.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you know of them?” And Sir Harold’s
great hungry eyes searched the major’s face. “They
believe me dead?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Sir Harold. Everybody believes you dead.
And I am dying to know how it is that you are alive.
Where have you been these fifteen months? How did
you escape the tiger?”</p>

<p>The desired explanation was delayed by the appearance
at the door of Mrs. Archer, who brought a jug of
warm spiced drink and a plate of food. The major
took the tray, and shut his wife out, returning to his
guest.</p>

<p>Sir Harold was nearly famished, and ate and drank
like one starving. When his hunger was appeased, and
a faint color began to dawn in his face, he pushed the
tray from him, and spoke in a firmer voice than he had
before employed.</p>

<p>“I have imagined terrible things about my wife and
Neva,” he said. “My poor wife! I have thought of her
a thousand times as dead of grief. Do you know, major,
how she took the report of my death?”</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said the major, “she nearly died of
grief. For a long time she shut herself up, and was inconsolable,
and when she did venture out at last, it was
in a funereal coach, and dressed in the deepest mourning.
There are few wives who mourn as she did.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s lips quivered.</p>

<p>“My poor darling!” he muttered inaudibly. “My<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
precious wife! I shall come back to you from the
dead.”</p>

<p>“Lady Wynde is heart-broken, they say,” said the
major. “One of the men in our mess, a lieutenant, is
from Canterbury and hears all the Kentish gossip, and
he says people were afraid that Lady Wynde would go
into a decline.”</p>

<p>“My poor wife!” said Sir Harold, with a sobbing
breath. “I knew how she loved me. We were all the
world to each other, Major. I must be careful how she
hears the news that I am living. The sudden shock may
kill her. Have you any news of my daughter also?”</p>

<p>“She was still at school when I last heard of her,”
answered the major. “There is no more news of your
home, Sir Harold. Your family are mourning for you
and you will bring back their lost happiness. You ought
to have seen your obituaries in the London papers.
Some of them were a yard long, and I’d be willing to die
to-day if I could only read such notices about myself.
That sounds a little Hibernian, but it’s true. And your
tenantry put on mourning, and they had funeral sermons
and so on. By all the rules, you ought to have been dead,
and, by the Lord Harry, I can’t understand why you are
not.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold smiled wanly.</p>

<p>“Let me explain why I am not,” he said. “You remember
that I was taking my last ride in India, and was
about to start for Calcutta, to embark for England, when
I disappeared? Some three days before that I had a
quarrel, if I might call it so, with the Hindoo Karrah&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know it. He told me about it for the first time this
morning.”</p>

<p>“You understand then that I had incurred his enmity
by kicking him out of this house? I found him stealing
the effects of my dead son. He had also stolen from me.<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
The letters he was stealing he was acute enough to know
were precious to me, and there was George’s diary, for
which I would not have taken any amount of money.
The scoundrel meant to get away with these, and then
sell them to me at his own terms. I took back my property,
and punished him as he deserved. I have now reason
to believe he went away that night to his friends among
the hills&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He did. He told me he did. But what did he go
for?” cried the major excitedly.</p>

<p>“You can soon guess. The next morning Karrah came
back, professing repentance,” said Sir Harold. “I reproached
myself for having been too harsh upon the poor
untaught heathen, and took him back. He accompanied
me upon that last ride, and was so humble, so deprecating,
so gentle, that I even felt kindly toward him. We
rode out into the jungle. I was in advance, riding slowly,
and thinking of home, when suddenly a monstrous tiger
leaped out of a thicket and fastened his claws in the neck
of my horse. I fought the monster desperately, for he
had pinned my leg to the side of my horse, and I could
not escape from him. We had a frightful struggle, and
I must have succumbed but for Karrah, who shot at the
tiger, wounding him, I think, in the shoulder, and frightening
him into retreat.”</p>

<p>“And so you escaped, when we all thought you
killed?” cried the major.</p>

<p>“My horse was dying,” said the baronet, “and I was
wounded and bleeding. I thought I was dying. I fell
from my saddle to the ground, groaning with pain.
Karrah came up, and bent over me, with a devilish smile
and moistened my lips with brandy from a flask he
carried. Then, muttering words in his own language
which I could not understand, he carried me to his own
horse, mounted, with me in his arms, and rode off in the<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
direction in which we had been going, and away from
your bungalow.”</p>

<p>“The scoundrel! What was that for?”</p>

<p>“After a half-hour’s ride, we came to a hollow, where
three natives were camped. Karrah halted, and addressed
them. They gathered around us, and then Karrah
said to me, in English, that he hated me, that he
would not kill me, but meant me to suffer, and that
these men were his brothers, who lived a score of miles
away up among the mountains. I was to be their slave.
He transferred me to their care, disregarding my pleas
and offered bribes, and rode away on his return to you.
I was carried on horseback, securely bound, a score of
miles to the north and westward. How I suffered on
that horrible journey, wounded as I was, I can never tell
you. A dozen times I thought myself dying.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder you did not die!”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Sir Harold. “We went through savage
jungles, and forded mountain torrents. We went up
hill and down, and more than once leaped precipices. I
was in a dead faint when we reached the home of the
three Hindoos, but afterward I found how wild and secluded
the spot was, and that there were no neighbors
for miles around. Their cabin was niched in a cleft in
a mountain, and hidden from the eye of any but the
closest searcher. Had you searched for me, you would
never have found me. It was in a rear hut, small and
dark, with a mud floor, and windowless walls, that I have
been a prisoner for fifteen months, major. My enemies,
for the most part, left me to myself, and I have dragged
out my weary captivity with futile plans of escape. Ah,
I have known more than the bitterness of death!”</p>

<p>“If we had only known it, we’d have scoured all
India for you, Sir Harold,” said the major hotly. “We’d
have strung up every native until we got the right ones.<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
But that episode of the tiger&mdash;for it seems that the tiger
was only an episode, coming into the affair by accident,
but greatly assisting Karrah’s foul treachery&mdash;threw us
off the scent, and made us think you dead. Why did
we not suspect the truth?”</p>

<p>“How could you? Don’t reproach yourself, major.
My chiefest sufferings during these horrible fifteen
months have been on account of my wife and my
daughter. To feel myself helpless, a slave to those
Hindoo pariahs, bound continually and in chains, while
Octavia and Neva were weeping for me and crying out
in their anguish, and perhaps needing me&mdash;ah, that was
almost too hard to bear! Now and then Karrah came
to taunt me in my prison, and to tell me how he hated
me, and how sweet was his revenge. He told me that
you had heard through a friend that my poor wife was
dying of her grief. After that I tried, with increased
ingenuity, to find some way of escape. Last night the
three Hindoos went away&mdash;upon a marauding expedition,
I think. After they had gone, one of the women
brought me my usual evening meal of boiled rice. I
pleaded to her to release me, but she laughed at me.
She went out, leaving the door open, intending to return
soon for the dish. The sight of the sky and of the
green earth without nerved me to desperation. I was
confined by a belt around my waist, to which an iron
chain was attached, the other end of the chain being secured
to a ring in the wall. I had wrenched my belt
and the chain a thousand times, but last night when I
pulled at it with the strength of a madman, it gave way.
I fell to the floor&mdash;unfettered!”</p>

<p>“You bounded up like an India rubber ball, I dare
swear?” cried the major, wiping his eyes sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I leaped up, and darted out of the door. There was<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
a horse tethered near the hut. I bounded on his back
and sped away, as the woman came hurrying out in
wild pursuit. I knew the general direction in which
your bungalow lay. I rode all night, going out of my
road, but being set straight again by some kindly Hindoos;
and here I am, weary, worn, but Oh, how thankful
and blest!”</p>

<p>The baronet bowed his head on his hands, and his
tears of joy fell thickly.</p>

<p>“You’re safe now, Sir Harold,” cried the major. “I
hear a hubbub outside. My fellows have got back, with
Karrah, no doubt. I want to superintend the skinning
him, and while I am gone, you can refresh yourself with
a bath, and put on a suit of Christian garments. My
wife is dying to see you. I hear her pacing the hall like
a caged leopardess. Get ready, and I’ll come back to
you as soon as you have had a little sleep. You’re
among friends, my dear Sir Harold; and, by Jove, I’m
glad to see you again!”</p>

<p>He pressed Sir Harold’s hand, catching his breath
with a peculiar sobbing, and hurried out.</p>

<p>His servants had returned, but Karrah had escaped.
The major indulged in some peculiar profanity, as he
listened to this report, and then withdrew to his wife’s
cool room, and told her Sir Harold’s story.</p>

<p>The baronet, meanwhile, took a bath and went to bed.
He slept for hours, awakening after noon. He shaved
and trimmed his beard, dressed himself in the suit of
clothes he had formerly worn, and which were now
much too large for him, and came forth into the central
hall of the dwelling. Major Archer was lounging here,
and came forward hastily, with both hands outstretched,
and with a beaming face.</p>

<p>“You look more like yourself, Sir Harold!” he exclaimed.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
“Mrs. Archer is out on the veranda, and is
full of impatience to see you.”</p>

<p>He linked his arm in the baronet’s and conducted him
out to the veranda, presenting him to Mrs. Archer, who
greeted him with a certain awe and kindliness, as one
would welcome a hero.</p>

<p>The little Archers were playing about under the
charge of an ayah, and they also came forward timidly
to welcome their father’s guest.</p>

<p>Tiffin&mdash;the India luncheon&mdash;was served on the veranda,
and after it was over, and the young people had
dispersed, Sir Harold said to his host:</p>

<p>“When does the next steamer leave for England?”</p>

<p>“Three days hence. You will have time to catch the
mail if you write to-day,” said Major Archer.</p>

<p>“Write! Why, I shall go in her, Major!”</p>

<p>“Impossible, Sir Harold. You are not fit for the voyage,”
said Mrs. Archer.</p>

<p>“I must go,” persisted the baronet, in a tone no one
could dispute. “Think of my wife&mdash;of my daughter.
Every day that keeps me from them seems an eternity.
Major, I was robbed by Karrah of every penny I possessed.
Plunder was a part of his motive, as well as desire
for revenge. I shall have to draw upon you for a
sufficient sum for my expenses.”</p>

<p>“It’s fortunate, and quite an unprecedented thing
with me, that I have a couple of hundred pounds in bank
in Calcutta,” said the major. “I wish it were a thousand,
but you’re quite welcome to it, Sir Harold&mdash;a
thousand times welcome. I appreciate your impatience
to be on your way home. If it were I, and your wife
was my Molly, I’d travel day and night&mdash;but there, I’ve
said enough. I’ll go to Calcutta with you, and see you
off on the <em>Mongolian</em>. I wish I could do more for you.”</p>

<p>“You can, Major. You can keep silence concerning<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
my reappearance,” declared Sir Harold thoughtfully.
“My wife is reported to be dying of grief. If she hears
too abruptly that I still live, the shock may destroy her.
Major, I am going home under a name not my own, that
the story of my adventures may not be bruited about
before she sees me. I will not reveal myself to any one
in Calcutta, nor to any one in England, before reaching
home. I will go quietly and unknown to Hawkhurst,
and reveal myself with all care and caution to Neva, who
will break the news to my wife.”</p>

<p>“Sir Harold is right,” said Mrs. Archer. “Lady
Wynde and Miss Wynde should not first hear the news
by telegraph, or letter, or through the newspapers. Their
impatience, anxiety, and suspense, after hearing that Sir
Harold still lives, and before they can see him, will be
terrible. The shock, as Sir Harold suggests, might
almost be fatal to Lady Wynde.”</p>

<p>“My wife is always right,” said the burly major, with
a glance of admiration at his spouse. “Sir Harold, you
cannot do better than to follow your instincts and my
Molly’s counsels. It is settled then, that you return to
England under an assumed name, and see your own family
before you proclaim your adventures to the world.
What name shall you adopt as a ‘name of voyage,’ to
translate from the French?”</p>

<p>“I will call myself Harold Hunlow,” said the baronet.
“Hunlow was my mother’s name. I am rested, Major,
and if you can give me a mount, we’ll be off at sunset
on our way to Calcutta.”</p>

<p>It was thus agreed. That very evening Sir Harold
Wynde and Major Archer set out for Calcutta on horseback,
arriving in time to secure passage in the <em>Mongolian</em>.
And on the third day after leaving Major Archer’s bungalow,
Sir Harold Wynde was at sea, and on his way to
England. Ah, what a reception awaited him!</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA’S DECISION ABOUT RUFUS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Could her guardian angel have whispered to Neva
that her father did indeed still live, and that at the very
moment of her vivid dream he stood upon the veranda
of Major Archer’s Indian bungalow, weak, wasted and
weary, but with the principle of life strong within him,
what agony she might have been spared in the near
future! what terrors and perils she might perhaps have
escaped!</p>

<p>But she did not know it&mdash;she could not guess that life
held for her a joy so rare, so pure, so sweet, as that of
welcoming back to his home her father so long and bitterly
mourned as dead.</p>

<p>As we have said, she remained awake during the remainder
of the night, walking her floor in her white
gown and slippered feet, now and then wringing her
hands, or sobbing softly, or crying silently; and thus
the weary hours dragged by.</p>

<p>Before the clear sunlight of the soft September morning,
which stole at last into her pleasant rooms, Neva’s
dream lost its vividness and semblance of reality, and
the conviction settled down upon her soul that it was
indeed “only a dream.”</p>

<p>She dressed herself for breakfast in a morning robe of
white, with cherry-colored ribbons, but her face was very
pale, and there was a look of unrest in her red-brown
eyes when she descended slowly and wearily to the
breakfast-room at a later hour than usual.</p>

<p>This room faced the morning sun, and was octagon
shaped, one half of the octagon projecting from the<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
house wall, and being set with sashes of French plate-glass,
like a gigantic bay-window. One of the glazed
sections opened like a door upon the eastern marble terrace,
with its broad surface, its carved balustrade, and
its rows of rare trees and shrubs in portable tubs.</p>

<p>There was no one in the room when Neva entered it.
The large table was laid with covers for five persons.
The glazed door was ajar, and the windows were all
open, giving ingress to the fresh morning air. The
room was all brightness and cheerfulness, the soft gray
carpet having a border of scarlet and gold, the massive
antique chairs being upholstered in scarlet leather, and
the sombreness of the dainty buffet of ebony wood being
relieved by delicate tracery of gold, drawn by a
sparing hand.</p>

<p>Neva crossed the floor and passed out upon the terrace,
where a gaudy peacock strutted, spreading his fan
in the sunlight, and giving utterance to his harsh notes
of self-satisfaction. Neva paced slowly up and down the
terrace, shading her face with her hand. A little later
she heard some one emerge from the breakfast room
upon the terrace, and come behind her with an irregular
and unsteady tread.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Neva,” said Rufus Black, as he
gained her side. “A lovely morning, is it not?”</p>

<p>Neva returned his salutation gravely. She knew that
Rufus Black had slept under the same roof with herself
the preceding night, after the ball, and that a room at
Hawkhurst had been specially assigned him by Lady
Wynde, now Mrs. Craven Black.</p>

<p>“You ought to have sacrificed your scruples, and come
down to the drawing-rooms last night,” said Rufus
Black. “I assure you we had a delightful time, but you
would have been the star of the ball. I watched the
door for your appearance until the people began to go<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
home, and I never danced, although there was no end of
pretty girls, but they were not pretty for me,” added
Rufus, sighing. “There is for me <em>now</em> only one beautiful
girl in the whole world, and you are she, sweet
Neva.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever love any one before you loved me?”
asked Neva, with a quiet frankness and straightforwardness,
looking up at him with her clear eyes full of dusky
glow.</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;no!” stammered Rufus, turning suddenly pale,
and his honest eyes blenching. “Almost every man has
had his boyish fancies, Miss Neva. Whatever mine may
have been, my life has been pure, and my heart is all
your own. You believe me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe you. Mr. and Mrs. Black have come
down to breakfast, Mr. Rufus. Let us go in.”</p>

<p>She led the way back to the breakfast room, Rufus
following. They found the bride and bridegroom and
Mrs. Artress waiting for them. Neva greeted Lady
Wynde by her new name, and bowed quietly to Craven
Black and Mrs. Artress. The little party took seats at
the table, and the portly butler, with a mute protest in
his heart against the new master of Hawkhurst, waited
upon them, assisted by skillful subordinates.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craven Black, dressed in white, looked the incarnation
of satisfaction. She had so far succeeded in the
daring game she had been playing, and her jet-black
eyes glittered, and her dark cheeks were flushed to
crimson, and her manner was full of feverish gayety, as
she did the honors of the Hawkhurst breakfast table to
her new husband.</p>

<p>Three years before she had been a poor adventuress,
unable to marry the man she loved. Now, through the
success of a daring and terrible conspiracy, she was
wealthy, the real and nominal mistress of one of the<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
grandest seats in England; the personal guardian of one
of the richest heiresses in the kingdom; and the wife of
her fellow-conspirator, to obey whose behests, and to
marry whom, she had been willing to peril her soul’s
salvation.</p>

<p>Only one thing remained to render her triumph perfect,
her fortune magnificent, and her success assured. Only
one move remained to be played, and her game would be
fully played.</p>

<p>That move comprehended the marriage of Neva Wynde
to Rufus Black, and Mrs. Craven Black, from the moment
of her third marriage, resolved to devote all her energies
to the task of bringing about the union upon which she
was determined.</p>

<p>The breakfast was eaten by Neva almost in silence.
When the meal was over Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black
strolled out into the gardens, arm in arm. Mrs. Artress,
who had fully emerged from her gray chrysalis, and who
was now dressed in pale blue, hideously unbecoming to
her ashen-hued complexion, retired to her own room to
enjoy her triumph in solitude, and to count the first installment
of the yearly allowance that had been promised
her, and which had already been paid her, with remarkable
promptness, by Lady Wynde.</p>

<p>Neva went to the music-room, and began to play a
weird, strange melody, in which her very soul seemed to
find utterance. In the midst of her abstraction, the door
opened, and Rufus Black came in softly.</p>

<p>He was standing at her side when her wild music
ceased abruptly, and she looked up from the ivory keys.</p>

<p>“Your music sounds like a lament, or a dirge,” said
Rufus, leaning upon the piano and regarding with admiration
the pale, rapt face and glowing eyes.</p>

<p>“I meant it so,” said Neva. “I was thinking of my
father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>“Ah,” said Rufus, rather vacantly.</p>

<p>“I dreamed of papa last night,” said Neva softly,
resting her elbow on the crashing keys and laying one
rounded cheek upon her pink palm. “I dreamed he was
alive, Rufus, and that I saw him standing before the
door of an Indian hut, or bungalow, or curious dwelling;
and my dream was like a vision.”</p>

<p>“A rather uncomfortable one,” suggested Rufus.
“You were greatly excited yesterday, Neva, I could see
that; and, as your mind was all stirred up concerning
your father, you naturally dreamed of him. It would
make a horrid row if your dream could only turn out
true, and you ought to rejoice that it cannot. You have
mourned for him, and the edge of your grief has worn
off&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, it has not,” interrupted the girl’s passionate
young voice. “If I had seen him die, I could have been reconciled
to the will of God. But to lose him in that awful
manner&mdash;never to know how much he suffered during
the moments when he was struggling in the claws of that
deadly tiger&mdash;oh, it seems at times more than I can bear.
And to think how soon he has been forgotten!” and
Neva’s voice trembled. “His wife whom he idolized
has married another, and his friends and tenantry have
danced and made merry at her wedding. Of all who
knew and loved him, only his daughter still mourns at
his awful fate!”</p>

<p>“It is hard,” assented Rufus, “but it’s the way of the
world, you know. If it will comfort you any, Neva, I
will tell you that half the county families came to the
wedding breakfast to support and cheer you by their
presence, and the other half came out of sheer curiosity.
But few of the best families remained to the ball.”</p>

<p>“Papa thought much of you, did he not, Rufus?”
asked Neva, thinking of that skilfully forged letter<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
which was hidden in her bosom, and which purported to
be her father’s last letter to her from India.</p>

<p>Rufus Black had been warned by his father that Neva
might some day thus question him, and Craven Black
had told his son that he must answer the heiress in the
affirmative. Rufus was weak of will, cowardly, and
timid, but it was not in him to be deliberately dishonest.
He could not lie to the young girl, whose truthful eyes
sought his own.</p>

<p>“I had no personal acquaintance with Sir Harold
Wynde, Neva,” the young man said, inwardly quaking,
yet daring to tell the truth.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;papa said&mdash;I don’t really comprehend,
Rufus. I thought that papa loved you.”</p>

<p>“If Sir Harold ever saw me, I do not know it,” said
Rufus, cruelly embarrassed, and wondering if his honesty
would not prove his ruin. “I was at the University&mdash;Sir
Harold may have seen me, and taken a liking to
me&mdash;”</p>

<p>Neva looked strangely perplexed and troubled. Certainly
the awkward statement of Rufus did not agree
with the supposed last declaration of her father.</p>

<p>“There seems some mystery here which I cannot
fathom,” she said. “I have a letter written by papa in
India, under the terrible foreboding that he would die
there, and in this letter papa speaks of you with affection,
and says&mdash;and says&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused, her blushes amply completing the sentence.</p>

<p>A cold shiver passed over the form of Rufus. He
comprehended the cause of Neva’s blushes, and a portion
of his father’s villainy. He understood that the
letter of which Neva spoke had been forged by Craven
Black, and that it commanded Neva’s marriage with
Craven Black’s son. What could he say? What should<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
he do? His innate cowardice prevented him from confessing
the truth, and his awe of his father prevented
him from betraying him, and he could only tremble and
blush and pale alternately.</p>

<p>“Papa might have taken an interest in you, without
making himself known to you,” suggested Neva, after a
brief pause. “Some act of yours might have made your
name known to him, and he might secretly have watched
your course without betraying to you his interest in you,
might he not?”</p>

<p>“He might,” said Rufus huskily.</p>

<p>“I can explain the matter in no other way. It is singular.
Perhaps poor papa might not have well known
what he was writing, but the letter is so clearly written
that that idea is not tenable. After all, so long as he
wrote the letter, what does it matter?” said Neva wearily.
“He must have known you, Rufus&mdash;or else the
letter was forged!”</p>

<p>Rufus averted his face, upon which a cold sweat was
starting.</p>

<p>“Who would have forged it?” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“That I do not know. I know no one base enough
for such a deed. It could not have been forged, of
course, Rufus, but the discrepancy between your statement
and that in the letter makes me naturally doubt.
Papa was the most truthful of men. He hated a lie,
and was so punctilious in regard to the truth that he
was always painfully exact in his statements. He trained
me to scorn a lie, and was even particular about the
slightest error in repeating a story. How then could he
speak of knowing you? Perhaps, though, I am mistaken.
I may find, on referring to the letter, that he
speaks of liking you and taking an interest in you, without
alluding to a personal acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“If I had known Sir Harold, I should have tried to<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
deserve his good opinion,” said Rufus, his voice trembling.
“I have the greatest reverence for his character,
and I wish I might be like him.”</p>

<p>“There are few like papa,” said Neva, a sudden glow
transfiguring her face.</p>

<p>“How you loved him, Neva. If I had had such a
father!” and Rufus sighed. “I would rather have an
honorable, affectionate father whom I could revere and
trust than to have a million of money!”</p>

<p>Neva reached out her hand in sympathy, and the
young man seized it eagerly, clinging to it.</p>

<p>“Neva,” he exclaimed, with a sudden energy of passion,
“it is more than a month since I asked you to be
my wife, and you have not yet given me my answer.
Will you give it to me now?”</p>

<p>The girl withdrew her hand gently, and rested her
cheek again on her hand.</p>

<p>“I know I am not worthy of you,” said Rufus, beseechingly.
“I am poor in fortune, weak of character, a
piece of drift-wood blown hither and thither by adverse
winds, and likely to be tossed on a rocky shore at last,
if you do not have pity upon me. Neva, such as I am,
I beseech you to save me!”</p>

<p>“I am powerless to save any one,” said Neva gently.
“Your help must come from above, Rufus.”</p>

<p>“I want an earthly arm to cling to,” pleaded Rufus,
his tones growing shrill with the sudden fear that she
would reject him. “I have in me all noble impulses,
Neva; I have in me the ability to become such a man
as was your father. I would foster all noble enterprises;
I would become great for your sake. I would study my
art and make a name of which you should be proud.
Will you stoop from your high estate, Neva, and have
pity upon a weak, cowardly soul that longs to be strong
and brave? Will you smile upon my great love for you,<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
and let me devote my life to your happiness and comfort?”</p>

<p>His wild eyes looked into hers with a prayerfulness
that went to her soul. He seemed to regard her as his
earthly saviour&mdash;and such indeed, if she accepted him,
she would be, for she would bring him fortune, and,
what he valued more, her affection, her pure life, her
brave soul, on which his own weak nature might be
stayed.</p>

<p>“Poor Rufus!” said Neva, with a tenderness that a
sister might have shown him. “My poor boy!” and her
small face beamed with sisterly kindness upon the tall,
awkward fellow, the words coming strangely from her
lips. “I am sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“And you will marry me?” he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>The young face became grave almost to sternness.
The lovely eyes gloomed over with a great shadow.</p>

<p>“I want to obey papa’s wishes as if they were commands,”
she said. “I have thought and prayed, day
after day and night after night. I like you, Rufus, and
I cannot hear your appeals unmoved. I believe I am
not selfish, if I am true to my higher nature, and obey
the instincts God has implanted in my soul. I must be
untrue to God, to myself, and to my own instincts, or I
must pay no heed to that last letter and to the last
wishes of poor papa. Which shall I do? I have decided
first one way, and then the other. The possibility that
that letter was&mdash;was not written by papa&mdash;and there is
such a possibility&mdash;I cannot now help but consider.
Forgive me, Rufus, but I have decided, and I think
papa, who has looked down from heaven upon my perplexity
and my anguish, must approve my course. I
feel that I am doing right, when I say,” and here her
hand took his, “that&mdash;that I cannot marry you.”</p>

<p>“Not marry me! Oh, Neva!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“It costs me much to say it, Rufus, but I must be
true to myself, to my principles of honor. I do not love
you as a wife should love her husband. I could not
stand up before God’s altar and God’s minister, and perjure
myself by saying that I thus loved you. No,
Rufus, no; it may not be!”</p>

<p>Rufus bowed his head upon the piano, and sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>His weakness appealed to the girl’s strength. She had
seldom seen a man in tears, and her own tears began to
flow in sympathy.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry, Rufus!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“But you will not save me? You will not lift a hand
to save me from perdition?”</p>

<p>“I will be your sister, Rufus.”</p>

<p>“Until you become some other man’s wife!” cried
Rufus, full of jealous anguish. “You will marry some
other man&mdash;Lord Towyn, perhaps?”</p>

<p>The girl retreated a few steps, a red glory on her features.
A strange sweet shyness shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I see!” exclaimed Rufus, in a passion of grief and
jealousy. “You will marry Lord Towyn? Oh, Neva!
Neva!”</p>

<p>“Rufus, it cannot matter to you whom I marry since
I cannot marry you. Let us be friends&mdash;brother and
sister&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will be all to you or nothing!” ejaculated Rufus
violently. “I will marry you or die!”</p>

<p>He broke from the grasp she laid upon him, and with
a wild cry upon his lips, dashed from the room.</p>

<p>In the hall he encountered Craven Black and his bride,
just come in from the garden. He would have brushed
past them unseeing, unheeding, but his father, seeing his
excitement and agitation, grasped his arm forcibly, arresting
his progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[239]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Craven Black fiercely.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to kill myself!” returned Rufus shrilly, trying
to break loose from that strong, unyielding clasp.
“It’s all over. Neva has refused me, and turned me
adrift. She is going to marry Lord Towyn!”</p>

<p>“Oh, is she?” said Craven Black mockingly. “We’ll
see about that.”</p>

<p>“We will see!” said Neva’s step-mother, with a cruel
and fierce compression of her lips. “I am Miss Wynde’s
guardian. We will see if she dares disobey her father’s
often repeated injunctions to obey me! If she does refuse,
she shall feel my power!”</p>

<p>“Defer your suicide until you see how the thing turns
out, my son,” said Craven Black, with a little sneer. “Go
to your room and dry your tears, before the servants
laugh at you.”</p>

<p>Rufus Black slunk away, miserable, yet with reviving
hope. Perhaps the matter was not ended yet? Perhaps
Neva would reconsider her decision?</p>

<p>As he disappeared up the staircase, Mrs. Craven Black
laid her hand on her bridegroom’s arm, and whispered:</p>

<p>“The girl will prove restive. We shall have trouble
with her. If we mean to force her into this marriage,
we must first of all get her away from her friends. Where
shall we take her? How shall we deal with her?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LALLY FINDS A NEW HOME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nearly six weeks had intervened between Rufus
Black’s proposal of marriage to Neva Wynde on the
road-side bank and his final rejection by her in the music-room
at Hawkhurst.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that there had been a hidden
witness to the half-despairing, half-loving, proposal of
Rufus, and that this hidden witness, seeing, but unseen,
was no other than the wronged young wife whom Rufus
Black mourned as dead, and whom in his soul he loved
a thousand-fold better than the beautiful young heiress.</p>

<p>During the six weeks that had passed, what had become
of Lally&mdash;poor, heart-broken, despairing Lally?</p>

<p>We have narrated how she staggered away in the
night gloom, after seeing Rufus and Neva together in
the square of light from the home windows upon the
marble terrace, not knowing whither she went, but hurrying
as swiftly as she might from her young husband,
from happiness, and from hope itself.</p>

<p>She had no thought of suicide. She had learned many
lessons by the bedside of her old friend the seamstress,
whose dying hours she had cheered. She had learned
that life may be very bitter and hard to bear, but that it
may not be thrown aside, or flung back in anger or
despair to the Giver. Its burdens must be borne, and
he who bears them with earnest patience, and in humble
obedience to the divine will, shall some day exchange
the cross of suffering for the crown of a great
reward. No; Lally, weak and frail as she was, deserted
by humanity, would never again seriously think of
suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>She wandered on in the soft starlight and moonlight,
a helpless, homeless, hopeless creature, with nowhere to
go, as we have said. She had no money in her pocket,
no food, and her shoes were worn out, and her clothes
were patched and darned and pitiably frayed and worn.
The very angels must have pitied her in her utter forlornness.</p>

<p>For an hour or two she tottered on, but at last wearied
to exhaustion, she sank down in the shelter of a way-side
hedge, and sobbed and moaned herself to sleep.</p>

<p>She was awake again at daybreak, and hurried up and
on, as if flying from pursuit. About eleven o’clock she
came to a hop-garden, divided from the road by wooden
palings. There were men and women, of the tramp
species, busy at work here under the supervision of the
hop farmer. Lally halted and clung to the palings with
both hands, and looked through the interstices upon the
busy groups with dilating eyes.</p>

<p>She was worn with anguish, but even her mental sufferings
could not still the demands of nature. She was
so hungry that it seemed as if a vulture were gnawing
at her vitals. She felt that she was starving.</p>

<p>The hop-pickers, many of them tramps who lived in
unions and alms-houses in the winter, and who stray
down into Kent during the hop season, presently discovered
the white and hungry face pressed against the palings,
and jeered at the girl, and called her names she
could not understand, making merry at her forlornness.</p>

<p>The hop raiser heard them, and discovering the object
of their rude merriment, came forward, opened a gate in
the palings, and hailed the girl. He was short of hands,
he said, and would give her sixpence a day, and food and
drink, if she chose to help in the hop picking.</p>

<p>Lally nodded assent, and crept into the gate, and into
the presence of those who mocked at her. Her eyes<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
were so wild, her manner so strange and still, that the
workers stared at her in wonder, whispered among
themselves, discovering that she was not of their kind,
and turned their backs upon her.</p>

<p>It was taken for granted that the new hand had had
her breakfast, and not a crust was offered to her. The
hop raiser had doubts about her sanity, and observed
her narrowly, but a dozen times that day he mentally
congratulated himself on his acquisition. Lally worked
with feverish energy, trying&mdash;ah, how vainly&mdash;to escape
from her thoughts, and she did the work of two persons.
She had bread and cheese and a glass of ale at
noon, and a similar allowance of food for supper.</p>

<p>That night she slept in a barn with the women tramps,
but chose a remote corner, where she buried herself in
the hay, and slept peacefully.</p>

<p>The next day she would have wandered on in her unrest,
but the farmer, discovering her intention, offered
her a shilling a day, and she consented to remain. That
night she again slept in her remote corner of the barn,
and no one spoke to her or molested her.</p>

<p>She made no friends among the tramps, not even
speaking to them. They were rude, vicious, quarrelsome.
She was educated and refined, had been the
teacher and companion of ladies, and was herself a lady
at heart. She went among these rude companions by
the soubriquet of “The Lady,” and this was the only
name by which the hop farmer knew her.</p>

<p>For a week Lally kept up this toil, laboring in the
hop-fields by day, and sleeping in a barn at night. At
the end of that period, the work being finished, she was
no longer wanted, and she went her way, resuming her
weary tramp, with six shillings and sixpence in her
pocket.</p>

<p>For the next fortnight she worked in various hop-fields,<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
paying nothing for food or lodging. Her pay
was better too, she earning a sovereign in the two
weeks.</p>

<p>Three weeks after overhearing Rufus solicit the hand
of Miss Wynde in marriage, Lally found herself at Canterbury,
shoeless and ragged, a very picture of destitution.
Her first act was to purchase a pair of shoes, a
ready-made print dress and a thin shawl. Her purchases
were all of the cheapest description, not costing her over
five shillings. She added to the list a round hat of
coarse straw, around which she tied a dark blue ribbon.</p>

<p>She found a cheap lodging in the town; and here put
on her new clothes. The lodging was an attic room,
with a dormer window, close up under the slates of a
humble brick dwelling. There was no carpet on her
floor, and the furniture comprised only an iron bed-stead,
a chair and a table. The house was rented by a tailor,
who used the ground floor for his shop and residence,
and sub-let the upper rooms to a half dozen different
families. The three attic rooms were let to women,
Lally being one, and two thin, consumptive seamstresses
occupying the others.</p>

<p>It was necessary for Lally to find employment without
delay, and she inserted an advertisement in one of
the local papers, soliciting a position as nursery governess.
She had the written recommendation of her former
employers, the superintendents of a ladies’ school, and
with this she hoped to secure a situation.</p>

<p>Her advertisement was repeated for three days without
result. Upon the fourth day, as she was counting
her slender store of money, and wondering what she was
to do when that was gone, the postman’s knock was
heard on the private door below, and presently the
tailor’s little boy came to Lally’s room bringing a letter.</p>

<p>She tore it open eagerly. It was dated Sandy Lands,<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
and was written in a painfully minute style of penmanship,
with faint and spidery letters. The writer was a
lady, signing herself Mrs. Blight. She stated that she
had a family of nine children, five of whom were young
enough to require the services of a nursery governess.
If “L. B.”&mdash;the initials Lally had appended to her advertisement&mdash;could
give satisfactory references, was an
accomplished musician, spoke French and German, and
was well versed in the English branches, she might call
at Sandy Lands upon the following morning at ten
o’clock.</p>

<p>Accordingly the next morning Lally set out in a cab
for Sandy Lands, whose location Mrs. Blight had described
with sufficient accuracy. It was situated in one
of the fashionable suburbs of the old cathedral town.
Lally expected from the grandeur of its name to find a
large and handsome estate, but found instead a pert
little villa, close to the road, and separated from it by a
high brick wall in which was a wooden gate. The domain
of Sandy Lands comprised a half-acre of rather
sterile soil, in which a few larches struggled for existence,
and an acacia and a lime tree led a sickly life.</p>

<p>The little villa, with plate-glass windows, green parlor
shutters drawn half-way up, a gabled roof, from which
three saucy little dormer windows protruded, was unmistakably
the house of which Lally was in search, for on
one side of the gate, over a slit in the wall required for
the use of the proper letter-box, was the legend in bright
gilt letters, “Sandy Lands.”</p>

<p>The cabman alighted and rang the garden bell. A
smart looking housemaid with white cap and white apron
answered the call. Lally alighted and asked if Mrs.
Blight were at home. The smart housemaid eyed the
humbly clad stranger rather contemptuously, and remarked<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
that she could not be sure; Mrs. Blight might
be at home, and then again she might not.</p>

<p>“I received a letter from her telling me to call at this
hour,” said Lally, with what dignity she could summon.
“I am seeking a situation as nursery governess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then Missus is at home,” replied the housemaid.
“You can come in, Miss.”</p>

<p>Bidding the cabman wait, Lally followed the servant
across the garden to a rear porch and was ushered into
a small over-furnished reception room.</p>

<p>“What name shall I say, Miss?” asked the maid, pausing
in the act of withdrawal.</p>

<p>“Miss Bird,” answered poor Lally, who had relinquished
her young husband’s name, believing that she
had no longer any right to it.</p>

<p>The maid went out, and was absent nearly twenty
minutes. Lally began to think herself forgotten, and
grew nervous, and engaged in a mental computation of
her cabman’s probable charges. The maid finally appeared,
however, and announced that “Missus was in
her boudoir, and would see the young person.”</p>

<p>Lally was conducted up stairs to a front room overlooking
the road. This room, like the one below, was
over-furnished. The wide window opened upon a balcony,
and before it, half-reclining upon a silken couch,
was a lady in a heavy purple silk gown, and a profusion
of jewelry&mdash;a lady, short, stout, and red-visaged, with a
nose much turned up at the end, and so ruddy as to induce
one to think it in a state of inflammation.</p>

<p>“Miss Bird!” announced the maid abruptly, flinging
in the words like a discharge of shot, and retired precipitately.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight turned her gaze upon Lally in a languid
curiosity, and waved her hand condescendingly, as an intimation
that the “young person” might be seated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>

<p>Lally sat down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight then raised a pair of gold-mounted eye-glasses
to her nose, and scrutinized Lally more closely,
after what she deemed a very high-bred and <em>nonchalant</em>
fashion indeed.</p>

<p>She beheld a humbly dressed girl, not past seventeen,
but looking younger, with a face as brown as a berry and
velvet-black eyes, which were strangely pathetic and sorrowful&mdash;a
girl who had known trouble evidently, but
who was pure and innocent as one might see at a glance.</p>

<p>“Ah, is your name Bird?” asked Mrs. Blight languidly.
“Seems as if I had heard the name somewhere, but I
can’t be sure. Of course you have brought references,
Miss Bird?”</p>

<p>“I have only a recommendation signed by ladies in
whose service I have been,” said Lally. “I have been
a music-teacher, but I possess the other accomplishments
you require.”</p>

<p>She drew forth the little worn slip of paper which she
had guarded as of more value to her than money,
because it declared her respectable and a competent
music-teacher, and gave it into the lady’s fat hands.</p>

<p>“It is not dated very lately,” said Mrs. Blight. “How
am I to know that this recommendation is not a forgery?
People do forge such things, I hear. Why, a
friend of mine took a footman on a forged recommendation,
and he ran away and took all her silver.”</p>

<p>Lally’s honest cheeks flushed, and her heart swelled.
She would have arisen, but that the lady motioned to
her to retain her seat, and so long as there was a prospect
that she might secure the situation Lally would
remain.</p>

<p>“The recommendation looks all right,” continued
Mrs. Blight, scanning it with her glass, while she held it
afar off, and daintily between two fingers, as if it were a<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
thing unclean. “You look honest too, but appearances
are <em>so</em> deceiving! I had a nurse girl once who looked
like a Madonna, and as if butter wouldn’t melt in her
mouth, but she turned out a perfect minx, artful as a
cat. What salary do you expect?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know, Madam. I have never been employed
as nursery governess.”</p>

<p>“My husband allows me forty pounds a year for the
salary of the governess,” said Mrs. Blight. “But, of
course, forty pounds ought to get a governess with the
very best of references. You are inexperienced, as you
confess. Now I will take the risk of you turning out
bad, if you should decide to remain with me as governess
to my five children, at a salary of twenty pounds a
year, board and washing, lights and fuel, included.”</p>

<p>It was “<a id="Ref_247" href="#BRef_247">Hobson’s</a> choice&mdash;that or none”&mdash;to poor
Lally. Twenty pounds a year, and to be sheltered and
fed and warmed besides, seemed very liberal after her
recent terrible struggle with the vulture of starvation.</p>

<p>“I will accept it, Mrs. Blight,” she said, her voice
trembling&mdash;“that is, if you will take me when you know
that I have only the clothes I stand in, and that for a
few weeks I shall need my pay weekly to provide me
with decent garments.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that,” said Mrs. Blight, “your clothes are
poor, beggarly, I might say. They will have to be improved
at once. I will advance you a quarter’s salary,
five pounds, if you are quite sure you will use it for
clothes, and that you do not intend to cheat me out of
my money. You see I always speak plainly. My governesses
are not pampered. They have to earn their
money, but that you probably expect to do. I don’t
know of another lady in Canterbury who would do as I
am doing, lending money to a perfect stranger, on a recommendation
you may have written yourself. But I<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
am different from other ladies. <em>I</em> am a judge of physiognomy,
and am not often deceived in my estimate of
people. Why are you out of clothes?”</p>

<p>“I have been out of a situation as a teacher for some
time,” said Lally. “I have the present addresses of the
ladies who signed my recommendation, and I beg you
to write to them to assure yourself that I have spoken
the truth. The addresses are written on the recommendation
itself.”</p>

<p>“I noticed them, and shall write this very morning,”
declared Mrs. Blight. “Go now for your clothes, and
be back to luncheon. I want to introduce you to the
children, who are running wild.”</p>

<p>She waved her hand, and Lally, with her five pounds
in her hand, took her departure. She had found a new
home, and one not likely to be pleasant, but it would
afford her shelter, and she believed she could bear all
things rather than to pass again through the poverty
and misery she had known. She little knew that it was
the hand of Providence that had brought her to Sandy
Lands, and that the acceptance of her present situation
was destined to change the entire future current of her
existence, and even to affect that of her young husband.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LALLY IN HER NEW SITUATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lally returned to Canterbury in the cab that had
brought her out to Sandy Lands, Mrs. Blight’s pert little
villa in the suburbs, and entered upon the task of procuring
a neat although necessarily scanty wardrobe.
She bought a cheap box, which she had sent to her<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
lodgings. A lady’s furnishing house yielded her a
change of under garments, another print dress, and a
gown of black alpaca, and a supply of collars and
cuffs; her entire purchases amounting to three pounds
ten shillings. She carried her effects to her attic lodgings,
the rent of which she had paid in advance, packed
her box, and set out again in the cab for Sandy Lands.</p>

<p>It was noon when the vehicle stopped again before the
little villa. The cabman rang the garden bell as before,
and when the housemaid appeared he dumped down
Lally’s box upon the gravelled walk, received his pay,
and departed. The smart housemaid was as contemptuous
as before of Lally’s humble garments, but spoke
to her familiarly, as if the two were upon a social level,
and conducted her toward the rear porch, saying:</p>

<p>“Missus said you was to be shown up to your room,
Miss, to make your twilet before seeing the children. If
you please,” added the girl, with increasing familiarity,
“you and I are to see a good deal of each other, and so
I want to know what to call you.”</p>

<p>Whatever the social rank of Lally’s parents, Lally herself
was a lady by instinct and education. The housemaid’s
easy patronage was offensive to her. She answered
quietly:</p>

<p>“You may call me Miss Bird.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the housemaid, with a sniff and a toss of
her head. “That’s the talk, is it? Well, then, Miss
Bird, follow me up to your room. This way, Miss Bird.
Up these stairs, Miss Bird.”</p>

<p>Lally followed her guide up the stairs to the third
and topmost story, and to a rear room.</p>

<p>“This is the room of the nussery governess,” said the
offended housemaid, her nose in the air. “The room on
your right is the school-room, Miss Bird. That on the
left is the nussery. You are to have your room to yourself,<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
Miss Bird, which I hopes will suit you. There’s no
petting of governesses in this here ’stablishment. You
rises at seven, Miss Bird, and eats with the children.
You begins lessons at nine o’clock, Miss Bird, and keeps
’em up till luncheon, and then comes music, langwidges,
and them sort. Dinner in the school-room, Miss Bird,
at five o’clock. Your evenings you has to yourself.”</p>

<p>“I shall receive my list of duties from Mrs. Blight,”
said Lally pleasantly, “but I am obliged to you all the
same.”</p>

<p>The housemaid’s face softened under Lally’s gentleness
and sweetness.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t wonder if she was a born lady, after all,”
the girl thought. “She won’t stand putting down, and
her face is that sorrowful I pity her.”</p>

<p>But she did not give expression to these thoughts.
What she did say was this:</p>

<p>“My name’s Loizy, and if I can do anything for you
just let me know. There’s my bell, and I must go.
When you get ready, come down stairs to Missus’s boo-door.”</p>

<p>She vanished just as the house boy, or Buttons, as he
was called, appeared with Lally’s box. He set this down
near the door, and also departed. Left alone, Lally examined
her new home with a faint thrill of interest.</p>

<p>The floor was bare, with the exception of a strip of
loose and threadbare carpet before the low brass bedstead.
There was a chintz-covered couch, a chintz-covered
easy-chair, a chest of drawers, and a green-shuttered
blind at the single window. The room had a dreary aspect,
but to Lally it was a haven of refuge.</p>

<p>She locked her door and knelt down and prayed,
thanking God that He had been so good to her as to
give her a safe shelter and a home. Then, rising, she
dressed herself as quickly as possible, putting on her<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
black alpaca dress, a spotless linen collar and cuffs, a
black sash, and a black ribbon in her hair. Thus attired,
she descended the stairs, finding the way to the boudoir,
at the door of which she knocked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight’s languid voice bade her enter.</p>

<p>She obeyed, finding her employer still reclining in an
armed chair, looking as if she had not moved since
Lally’s previous visit. She had a book in one hand, a
paper cutter in the other. She recognized Lally with a
sort of pleased surprise.</p>

<p>“Ah, back again, and punctual!” she exclaimed, glancing
at a toy clock in white and blue enamel on the low
mantel-piece. “I had a great many misgivings after
you went away, Miss Bird. Five pounds is a good deal
of money to one in your position in life, and the world
is <em>so</em> full of swindlers. I have already written to the
ladies to whom you referred me. I suppose I should
have waited for their answer before engaging you, but I
am such an impulsive creature, I always do just as I feel
at the spur of the moment. My husband calls me ‘a
child of impulse,’ and the words describe me exactly.
I’m glad to see you back. I don’t know, I’m sure, what
I should have said to Mr. Blight if you had decamped,
for he does not appreciate my ability to read faces.
The time I got taken in with my last cook&mdash;the one
we found lying with her head in a brass kettle, and
the kitchen fire gone out, at the very hour when I had a
large company assembled to dine with me&mdash;Charles said,
‘Fudge, don’t let us hear any more about physiognomy.’
You see, I engaged the woman because her face was all
that could be desired. And since that time Charles
won’t hear a word about physiognomy.”</p>

<p>Lally sat down, obeying a wave of Mrs. Blight’s hand.
That “child of impulse,” silly, garrulous, and puffed up<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
with self-importance and vulgarity, pursued her theme
until she had exhausted it.</p>

<p>“You are looking very well, Miss Bird,” she said,
changing the subject, “but all in black&mdash;why, you are
quite a black-bird, I declare,” and she laughed at her
own wit. “Are you in mourning? Have you lately
lost a friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” replied Lally sorrowfully, “I have
lately lost the only friend I had in the whole world.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed. That is sad; but I do hope you won’t
wear a long face and go moping about the house, frightening
the children,” said Mrs. Blight, with a candor that
was less charming than oppressive to her newly engaged
governess. “You must do as the poet so romantically
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent10">“‘Wear a smile,
</div><div class="indent0">Though the cold heart runs darkly to ruin the while.’
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“If he doesn’t say that, it’s some such thing, and a very
pretty sentiment too. And now let us discuss your new
duties.”</p>

<p>She proceeded to sketch Lally’s duties much as the
housemaid had done. Then she gave a history of each
one of the five children who were to be under Lally’s
supervision. Three of the children were boys, and their
fond mother described them as paragons. Her girls
also were extraordinary in their mental and physical
attractions, “having once been taken at the Zoological
gardens during a visit to London, by a strange gentleman,
for the children of a nobleman!”</p>

<p>“I will accompany you to the nursery, Miss Bird,”
said the lady, arising. “I desire to introduce you to my
darlings. I have great faith in the instincts of children,
and I want to see what my children think of you.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Mrs. Blight conducted Lally again to the<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
upper floor and to the nursery, which was at the moment
of their entrance in a state of wildest confusion
and disorder.</p>

<p>The nurse, a stout old woman, and the nursemaid, a
red-faced young girl, were in a state of despair, and
frantically holding their hands to their ears, while five
robust, boisterous, frouzy-headed children rode about
the room upon chairs, played “tag,” and otherwise disported
themselves.</p>

<p>The entrance of Mrs. Blight and Lally caused a cessation
of the noise. The mother called her children to
her, but they retreated with their fingers in their mouths,
looking askance at their new governess. The three
“noble boys” presently set up a loud bellowing, and the
two girls who had been “mistaken by a strange gentleman
for the children of a nobleman,” hid behind their
nurses.</p>

<p>It required all the persuasions, coupled with threats,
of Mrs. Blight, to induce her shy children to show themselves
to Lally. It appeared that they had a horror of
governesses, regarding them as tyrants and ogresses created
especially to destroy the happiness of children; but
Lally’s smiles, added to the fact that she looked but little
more than a child, finally induced them to be sociable
and to approach her.</p>

<p>“In a day or two you won’t be able to do anything
with them, Miss,” said the head nurse. “They’ll ride
rough-shod over you.”</p>

<p>“They are so spirited,” murmured Mrs. Blight.
“Study their characters closely, Miss Bird, and be very
tender with them. I have one child more than the
Queen, and my children are named for the royal family.
These three boys are Leopold, Albert Victor, and
George. The girls are named Victoria and Alberta.
My elder children are at school. Children, this is Miss<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
Bird, your new governess. Now come with her into the
school-room. Lessons begin immediately.”</p>

<p>The little flock, with Lally at their head, was conducted
to the school-room, a large, bare apartment, furnished
with two benches, a teacher’s chair and desk, and
a black-board. Here Mrs. Blight left them, convinced
that she had fulfilled her duties as parent and employer,
and returned to her book.</p>

<p>Lally proceeded to examine into the acquirements of
her pupils, finding them lamentably ignorant. Lessons
were given out, but there was no disposition on the part
of her pupils to study. They threw paper balls at each
other, whispered and giggled, and altogether proved
at the very outset a sore trial to their young teacher.
Their shyness lasted for but a brief period, and then,
having no longer fear of the sad-faced governess, they
began to romp about the room, to shout, and to engage
in a general game of frolics.</p>

<p>Lally had a vein of decision in her character, and with
the exercise of a gentle firmness induced her pupils to
return to their seats. She explained their lessons to
them, with an unfailing patience, but the hours of that
September afternoon seemed almost endless to her.
The children were froward, disobedient, and idle. They
had been spoiled by their mother, and were full of mischievous
tricks, so that Lally’s soul wearied within her.</p>

<p>Dinner, a very plain and frugal one, was served to the
governess and the children in the school-room at five
o’clock. After dinner, Lally’s time belonged to herself,
and she put on her hat and went out for a walk, having
a longing for the fresh air.</p>

<p>This first day at Sandy Lands was a fair type of the
days that followed. The children, under Lally’s firm
but gentle rule, became more quiet and studious, and
conceived an affection for their young governess. Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
Blight was delighted with their improvement. She had
received a reply from Lally’s former employers, giving
the young girl very high praise, and was consequently
well pleased with herself for securing such valuable services
as Lally’s at a salary less than half she had ever
before paid to a governess.</p>

<p>Mr. Blight was a lawyer in good practice at Canterbury,
and spent his days at his office, returning to Sandy Lands
to dine, and leaving home immediately after breakfast.
He was a small, ferret-eyed man, always in a hurry,
a mere money making machine, with a great ambition to
make or acquire a fortune. At present he lived fully up
to his income, a fact which gave both him and Mrs.
Blight much secret anxiety. With ten children to educate
and provide for, several servants to pay, a carriage
and pair for Mrs. Blight, and the lawyer’s wines, cigars,
frequent elaborate dinners to his friends, and other items
by no means small to settle, Mr. Blight was continually
harassed by debt, and yet had not sufficient strength of
will to reduce his expenses and live within his income.</p>

<p>One cause, perhaps, of their indiscreet self-indulgence
was that they had “expectations.”</p>

<p>There was an old lady connected with the family, the
widow of a wealthy London banker who had been Mr.
Blight’s uncle. This old lady was supposed to have no
relatives of her own to enrich at her death, and the
Blights had lively hopes of inheriting her fifty thousand
pounds, which had descended to her absolutely at her
husband’s death, and of which she was free to dispose as
she might choose.</p>

<p>This lady lived in London, at the West End, was very
eccentric, very irascible, and went little in society, being
quite aged and infirm. She was in the habit of coming
down to Sandy Lands annually in September, ostensibly
to spend a month with her late husband’s relatives; but<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
she always returned home within a week, alleging that
she could not bear the noise of the Blight children, and
that a month under the same roof with them would deprive
her of life or reason. It was now about the time
of this lady’s annual visit, and one morning, when Lally
had been about two weeks at Sandy Lands, Mrs. Blight
came up to the school-room, an open letter in her hand,
and dismissing the children to the nursery for a few minutes,
said confidentially:</p>

<p>“Miss Bird, I have just received a letter from the
widow of my husband’s uncle, a remarkable old lady,
with fifty thousand pounds at her own absolute disposal.
My husband is naturally the old lady’s heir, being her
late husband’s nephew, and we expect to inherit her property.
Her name is Mrs. Wroat.”</p>

<p>“An odd name!” murmured Lally.</p>

<p>“And she’s as odd as her name,” declared Mrs. Blight.
“She comes here at this time every year, and always
brings a parrot, a lap-dog, a band-box in a green muslin
case, a blue umbrella, and a snuffy old maid, who eyes us
all as if we had designs on her mistress’s life. The absurd
old creature is devoted to her mistress, who is a mere
bundle of whims and eccentricities. The old lady calls for a
cup of coffee at midnight, and she hates our dear children,
and she thrashed Leopold with her cane last year, because
he put nettles in her bed and flour on her best cap,
the poor dear innocent child. And I never dared to interfere
to save Leopold, though his screams rang through
the house, and I stood outside her door listening and
peeping, for you know we must have her fifty thousand
pounds, even if she takes the lives of all my darlings!”
and Mrs. Blight’s tone was pathetic. “She’s a nasty old
beast&mdash;there! Of course I say it in confidence, Miss
Bird. It would be all up with us, if Aunt Wroat were to
hear that I said that. She’s very tenacious of respect,<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
and all that bother, and insisted I should punish Albert
Victor because he called her ‘an old curmudgeon.’”</p>

<p>“When do you expect this lady?” asked Lally.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, with her maid, lapdog, parrot, umbrella
and bandbox. She writes that she will stay a month,
and that she must have no annoyance from the children,
and that she won’t have them in her room&mdash;the old nuisance!
If it wasn’t for her money, I’d telegraph her to
go to Guinea, but as we are situated I can’t. I must put
up with her ways. And what I want of you, Miss Bird,
is to see that the children do not stir off this floor while
she is here. Let them die for want of exercise, the poor
darlings, rather than we offend this horrid old woman.
If we sacrifice ourselves, she can’t leave her property to
some fussy old charity, that’s one comfort.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best to keep the children out of Mrs.
Wroat’s sight,” said Lally gravely.</p>

<p>“You must succeed in doing so, for the old lady says
this will probably be her last visit to us, as she is growing
more and more infirm, and she hints that it is time
to make her will. Everything depends upon her reception
on the occasion of this visit. Let her get miffed at
us, and it’s all up. I declare I wish I had a place where
I could hide the children during her stay. She must not
see or hear them, Miss Bird.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything more that I can do, Mrs. Blight?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she always has the governess play upon the
piano and sing to her in the evening. She is fond of
music, desperately so. We always hire a cottage piano
and put it in her sitting-room while she stays, and the
governess plays to her there evenings. She’s very liberal
with a governess who can play well. She gave Miss
Oddly last year a five-pound note. And always when
she leaves us after a visit, she hands me twenty pounds
and says she never wants to be indebted to anybody, and<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
that’s to defray her expenses while here. I have to
take it. I wouldn’t dare to refuse it.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to amuse her in any way, Mrs. Blight,”
declared the young governess. “I shall not mind her
eccentricities, and shall remember that she is ‘aged and
infirm.’”</p>

<p>“And she has fifty thousand pounds which we must
have,” said Mrs. Blight. “Don’t fail to remember that!”</p>

<p>Much relieved at having guarded against a meeting
between her expected guest and her children, Mrs. Blight
departed to seek an interview with her cook.</p>

<p>Extensive preparations were made that day for the reception
of Mrs. Wroat. Two rooms were prepared for
her use, one of them having two beds, one bed being for
the use of the maid. A cottage piano was hired and put
into one of the rooms. The choicest articles of furniture
in the house were arranged for her use. The hint that
Mrs. Wroat was thinking of making her will was sufficient
to render her time-serving, money-hunting relatives
gentle, pliable, and apparently full of tender anxiety for
her happiness and comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Blight was informed of the good news when he
came home to dinner, and he sought a personal interview
with his children’s governess, entreating her to
keep the youngsters out of sight during the visit of Mrs.
Wroat, as she valued her situation.</p>

<p>Everything being thus arranged, it only remained for
the guest to arrive.</p>

<p>No. 232 of the <span class="smcap">Select Library</span>, entitled “Neva’s
Choice,” is the sequel to the foregoing novel, and the
story of Neva’s romance, together with the intrigues and
plottings of her enemies, is charmingly brought to its
conclusion.</p>

<p>You will find her in almost every generation, in almost every
country, in almost every city. She is not a typical adventuress,
she is not a genius. The reason for her strong power is occult.
The nameless charm is found as often in homely, clumsy, dull,
old masculine women as in the reverse of these types.</p>

<p class="xlargefont boldfont center">What Makes a Superwoman?</p>

<p>If you think the problem worth while, why not try to solve it
by reading Albert Payson Terhune’s great book, SUPERWOMEN?
From Cleopatra to Lady Hamilton&mdash;they are mighty
interesting characters. Some of them smashed thrones, some
of them were content with wholesale heart smashing. You
will know their secret, or rather their secrets, for seldom did
two of them follow the same plan of campaign.</p>

<p>We have prepared a very handsome, special, limited edition
of the book, worthy of a place on your “best book” shelf. If
you subscribe to AINSLEE’S MAGAZINE now you can purchase
it for 50c. Send us a money order for $2.50 and receive
SUPERWOMEN postpaid, and, in addition, over 1900 pages of
splendid fiction throughout the coming year. AINSLEE’S
MAGAZINE is the best and smartest purely fiction magazine
published. You cannot invest $2.50 in reading matter to better
advantage than by availing yourself of this offer. Send check

World War</p>

<p class="center xlargefont boldfont"><em><span class="largefont">By</span> Thomas R. Best</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">The most portentous crisis in the history
of the human family has just passed.
The World War was conceived in greed
and will be consummated in justice. It will
prove a blessing to mankind, because it spells
emancipation to countless unborn generations
from enslaving political and social
evils. It is a big subject and one that will
be discussed in every household for many
years to come. Questions will arise that
only a clear, concise account of the war
in handy form can settle.</p>

<p>Therefore, we ask you to consider <cite><b>History
of the World War</b></cite> by Thomas R. Best
which has been written from the American
standpoint. It is purely history&mdash;not vituperation.
This volume has a chronology of
important events that will prove of inestimable
reference value.</p>

<p>The demand has been greater than the supply,
the latter having been somewhat restricted on

presses night and day turning out “good ones”
for the consumption of men and women who
want good reading matter and who have got to

buy a copy of No. 1020 <span class="smcap">New Eagle Series</span>&mdash;SLIGHTED

by every woman.</p>

<p>For sixty-four consecutive years, Street &amp;

wholesome fiction. During this time we gave
the public what it wanted, and as the demand
changed, our publications changed with it.</p>

<p>What most American readers want at present
are the S. &amp; S. novels, especially those in the <span class="smcap">New

wrote straightaway American love stories of exceptional

<p class="xxlargefont boldfont center" style="word-spacing:0.15em">A REQUEST</p>

<p>Conditions due to the war have made it very difficult
for us to keep in print all of the books listed in our
catalogues. We still have about fifteen hundred different
titles that we are in a position to supply. These
represent the best books in our line. We could not afford,
in the circumstances, to reprint any of the less
popular works.</p>

<p>We aim to keep in stock the works of such authors as
Bertha Clay, Charles Garvice, May Agnes Fleming,
Nicholas Carter, Mary J. Holmes, Mrs. Harriet Lewis,
Horatio Alger, and the other famous authors who are
represented in our line by ten or more titles. Therefore,
if your dealer cannot supply you with exactly the
book you want, you are almost sure to find in his stock
another title by the same author, which you have not
read.</p>

<p>It short, we are asking you to take what your dealer
can supply, rather than to insist upon just what you
want. You won’t lose anything by such substitution,
because the books by the authors named are very uniform
in quality.</p>

<p>In ordering Street &amp; Smith novels by mail, it is advisable
to make a choice of at least two titles for each
book wanted, so as to give us an opportunity to substitute
for titles that are now out of print.</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
